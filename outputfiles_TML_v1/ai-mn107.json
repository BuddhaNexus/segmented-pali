    "ai-mn107:11.2_0": "But for those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—these things lead to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness.”",

    "ai-mn107:15.2_0": "“Master Gotama, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not committed to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and stupid. Master Gotama doesn’t live together with these.",

    "ai-mn107:17.1_0": "Wonderful, good Gotama, wonderful!",
    "ai-mn107:17.2_0": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.",
    "ai-mn107:17.2_1": "those with eyes might see what’s there—",
    "ai-mn107:17.2_2": "just so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways.",
    "ai-mn107:17.3_0": "Good Gotama, I go for refuge to you, and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks.",
    "ai-mn107:17.4_0": "From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”",
