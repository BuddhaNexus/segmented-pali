    "ai-snp3.7:9.8_0": "Wait until I’ve finished speaking.”",
    "ai-snp3.7:10.1_0": "Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.",
    "ai-snp3.7:10.2_0": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.",
    "ai-snp3.7:10.3_0": "and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.",

    "ai-snp3.7:11.5_0": "The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his retracted private parts.",
    "ai-snp3.7:11.6_0": "And the Buddha split the tongue and applied each, with his ears and nose. Then he didn’t touch both sides, bracelet, wrigged, and cook them.",
