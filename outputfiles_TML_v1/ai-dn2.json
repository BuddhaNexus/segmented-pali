    "ai-dn2:13.2_0": "He said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn2:13.3_0": "“Sir, I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”",

    "ai-dn2:14.2_0": "This includes such topics as applying happiness as a charioteer, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants.",
    "ai-dn2:14.3_0": "They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present life.",
    "ai-dn2:14.4_0": "They pass away from that host of happiness. They nurture happiness and are conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven.",
    "ai-dn2:14.5_0": "Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in the present life?”",
    "ai-dn2:15.1_0": "“Great king, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?”",

    "ai-dn2:17.2_1": "They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.",

    "ai-dn2:18.6_0": "So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa.",
    "ai-dn2:18.7_0": "I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left.",

There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 7000 dreams.

    "ai-dn2:20.11_0": "In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’",
    "ai-dn2:21.1_0": "And so, when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration.",
