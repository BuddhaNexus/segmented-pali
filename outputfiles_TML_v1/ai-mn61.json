    "ai-mn61:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-mn61:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.",
    "ai-mn61:2.1_0": "Now at that time Venerable Rāhula was staying in Ambalaṭṭhikā.",
    "ai-mn61:2.2_0": "Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable Rāhula.",
    "ai-mn61:2.3_0": "Rāhula saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.",
    "ai-mn61:2.4_0": "He spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.",
    "ai-mn61:2.5_0": "The Buddha sat on the seat spread out",
    "ai-mn61:2.6_0": "and sat on it.",
    "ai-mn61:2.7_0": "Rāhula bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn61:3.1_0": "Then the Buddha, leaving a little water in the pot, addressed Rāhula,",
    "ai-mn61:3.2_0": "“Rāhula, do you see this little bit of water left in the pot?”",
    "ai-mn61:3.3_0": "“Yes, sir,” they replied.",
    "ai-mn61:3.4_0": "“That’s how little of the ascetic’s nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”",
    "ai-mn61:4.1_0": "Then the Buddha, tossing away what little water was left in the pot, said to Rāhula,",
    "ai-mn61:4.2_0": "“Do you see this little bit of water that was tossed away?”",
    "ai-mn61:4.3_0": "“Yes, sir,” they replied.",
    "ai-mn61:4.4_0": "“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is tossed away in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”",
    "ai-mn61:5.1_0": "Then the Buddha, turning the pot upside down, said to Rāhula,",
    "ai-mn61:5.2_0": "“Do you see how this pot is the water pot?”",
    "ai-mn61:5.3_0": "“Yes, sir,” they replied.",
    "ai-mn61:5.4_0": "“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”",
    "ai-mn61:6.1_0": "Then the Buddha, turning the pot right side up, said to Rāhula,",
    "ai-mn61:6.2_0": "“Do you see how this pot is vacant and hollow?”",
    "ai-mn61:6.3_0": "“Yes, sir,” they replied.",
    "ai-mn61:6.4_0": "“That’s how vacant and hollow the ascetic’s nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.",
    "ai-mn61:7.1_0": "Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree and battle-hardened. In battle it uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, but it still protects its trunk.",
    "ai-mn61:7.1_1": "like a burning flame.",
    "ai-mn61:7.2_0": "So its rider thinks:",
    "ai-mn61:7.3_0": "‘This royal bull elephant still protects its trunk.",
    "ai-mn61:7.3_1": "because of he does not act",
    "ai-mn61:7.3_2": "like a burning flame.",
    "ai-mn61:7.4_0": "It has not yet given its life.’",
    "ai-mn61:7.5_0": "But when that royal bull elephant ... in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk, its rider thinks:",
    "ai-mn61:7.5_1": "They don’t act with a single word by the hand, thinking,",
    "ai-mn61:7.6_0": "‘This royal bull elephant ... in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk.",
    "ai-mn61:7.7_0": "It has given its life.",
    "ai-mn61:7.8_0": "Now there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not do.’",
    "ai-mn61:7.9_0": "In the same way, when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say.",
    "ai-mn61:7.10_0": "So you should train like this: ‘I will not tell a lie, even for a joke.’",

    "ai-mn61:8.1_0": "What do you think, Rāhula?",
    "ai-mn61:8.2_0": "What is the purpose of a mirror?”",
    "ai-mn61:8.3_0": "“It’s for checking your reflection, sir.”",
    "ai-mn61:8.4_0": "“In the same way, deeds of body, speech, and mind should be done only after repeated checking.",
    "ai-mn61:9.1_0": "When you want to act with the body, you should check on that same deed:",
