    "ai-dn6:2.1_0": "Then they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the Buddha.",

    "ai-dn6:4.1_2": "He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,",
    "ai-dn6:4.2_0": "“Sir, Kassapa, these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were here to see the Buddha.",
    "ai-dn6:4.2_1": "Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also come here to see the Buddha. It’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”",
    "ai-dn6:4.3_0": "“Well then, Sīha, please tell the Buddha about this.”",
    "ai-dn6:4.4_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha.",
    "ai-dn6:4.4_1": "bowed down to the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn6:4.4_2": "He went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of the people waiting to see him, adding:",

    "ai-dn6:4.8_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha, and he did so.",
    "ai-dn6:4.9_0": "Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out.",
    "ai-dn6:5.1_0": "Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha, and",

    "ai-dn6:5.2_0": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side,",
    "ai-dn6:5.3_0": "Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha.",
    "ai-dn6:5.3_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-dn6:5.3_2": "Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn6:5.3_3": "“Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me.",
    "ai-dn6:5.3_4": "and said to me:",
    "ai-dn6:5.4_0": "‘Mahāli, soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years. I see heavenly sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, but I don’t hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing.’",

    "ai-dn6:6.5_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-dn6:6.6_0": "Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way.",

    "ai-dn6:13.3_0": "This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.",
    "ai-dn6:13.4_0": "Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.",
    "ai-dn6:13.5_0": "This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.",
    "ai-dn6:13.6_0": "Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.",
    "ai-dn6:13.7_0": "This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.",
    "ai-dn6:13.8_0": "Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.",
