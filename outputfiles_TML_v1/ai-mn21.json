    "ai-mn21:7.13_0": "This is what should be done by me, mendicants, I reconcile with them.",
    "ai-mn21:7.14_0": "So, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.",
    "ai-mn21:7.15_0": "You will achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.",
    "ai-mn21:8.1_0": "Suppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal trees",
    "ai-mn21:8.2_0": "that was choked with castor-oil weeds.",

    "ai-mn21:9.8_0": "But does she actually have anger in her and just not show it? Or does she have no anger?",
    "ai-mn21:9.9_0": "Or is it just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside?",
    "ai-mn21:9.10_0": "Why don’t I test my mistress?’",
    "ai-mn21:9.11_0": "So Kāḷī got up during the day.",
    "ai-mn21:9.12_0": "Then the housewife Kāḷī said to me,",
    "ai-mn21:9.13_0": "‘You’re Kāḷī,’",

    "ai-mn21:9.15_0": "‘You’re getting up later in the day—what’s up with you, girl?’",

    "ai-mn21:9.17_0": "‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up in the day!’ Angry and upset, she scowled.",

    "ai-mn21:9.21_0": "Why don’t I test my mistress?’",
    "ai-mn21:9.22_0": "So Kāḷī got up later in the day.",

    "ai-mn21:9.28_0": "‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she blurted out angry words.",
    "ai-mn21:9.29_0": "Then Kāḷī thought,",
    "ai-mn21:9.30_0": "‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.",
    "ai-mn21:9.31_0": "She just has well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside?",

    "ai-mn21:9.33_0": "So Kāḷī got up later in the day.",
    "ai-mn21:9.34_0": "Then the housewife Kāḷī said to me,",
    "ai-mn21:9.35_0": "‘You’re Kāḷī,’",
    "ai-mn21:9.36_0": "‘Venerable,’",
    "ai-mn21:9.37_0": "‘You’re getting up later in the day—what’s up with you, girl?’",
    "ai-mn21:9.38_0": "‘That’s not easy for what it is.’",
    "ai-mn21:9.39_0": "‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up even later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she grabbed a rolling-pin and hit Kāḷī on the head, cracking it open.",
    "ai-mn21:9.40_0": "Then Kāḷī, with blood pouring from her cracked skull, denounced her mistress to the neighbors,",
    "ai-mn21:9.41_0": "‘See, ladies, what the sweet one did!",
    "ai-mn21:9.42_0": "See what the even-tempered one did! See what the calm one did!",
    "ai-mn21:9.43_0": "How on earth can she grab a rolling-pin and hit her only maid on the head, cracking it open, just for getting up late?’",
    "ai-mn21:9.44_0": "Then after some time the housewife Vedehikā got this bad reputation:",
    "ai-mn21:9.45_0": "‘The housewife Vedehikā is fierce, ill-tempered, and not calm at all.’",
    "ai-mn21:10.1_0": "In the same way, a mendicant may be the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they don’t encounter any disagreeable criticism.",
    "ai-mn21:10.2_0": "But it’s when they encounter disagreeable criticism that you’ll know whether they’re really sweet, even-tempered, and calm.",
    "ai-mn21:10.3_0": "I don’t say that a mendicant is easy to admonish if they make themselves easy to admonish only for the sake of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.",
    "ai-mn21:10.4_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn21:10.5_0": "Because when they don’t get robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, they’re no longer easy to admonish.",
    "ai-mn21:10.6_0": "But when a mendicant is easy to admonish purely because they honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching, then I say that they’re easy to admonish.",
    "ai-mn21:10.7_0": "So, mendicants, you should train yourselves: ‘We will be easy to admonish purely because we honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching.’",
    "ai-mn21:10.8_0": "That’s how you should train.",
