    "ai-dn27:0.2_0": "What Came First",
    "ai-dn27:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-dn27:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.",
    "ai-dn27:1.3_0": "Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being ordained.",
    "ai-dn27:1.4_0": "Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse.",
    "ai-dn27:2.1_0": "Vāseṭṭha saw him",
    "ai-dn27:2.2_0": "and said to Bhāradvāja,",
    "ai-dn27:2.3_0": "“Reverend Bhāradvāja, the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse.",
    "ai-dn27:2.4_0": "Come, reverend, let’s go to the Buddha.",
    "ai-dn27:2.5_0": "Hopefully we’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from him.”",
    "ai-dn27:2.6_0": "“Yes, reverend,” replied Bhāradvāja.",
    "ai-dn27:2.7_0": "So they went to the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn27:2.7_1": "He went to the Buddha, bowed, and walked beside him.",
    "ai-dn27:3.1_0": "Then the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha,",
    "ai-dn27:3.2_0": "“Vāseṭṭha, you are both brahmins by birth and clan, and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family. I hope you don’t have to suffer abuse and insults from the brahmins.”",
    "ai-dn27:3.3_0": "“Actually, sir, the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical insults to the fullest extent.”",
    "ai-dn27:3.4_0": "“But how do the brahmins insult you?”",
    "ai-dn27:3.5_0": "“Sir, the brahmins say:",
    "ai-dn27:3.6_0": "‘Only brahmins are the first caste; other castes are inferior.",
    "ai-dn27:3.7_0": "Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.",
    "ai-dn27:3.8_0": "Only brahmins are purified, not others.",
    "ai-dn27:3.9_0": "Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.",
    "ai-dn27:3.10_0": "You’ve both abandoned the first caste to join an inferior caste, namely these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman.",
    "ai-dn27:3.11_0": "This is not right, it’s not proper!’",
    "ai-dn27:3.12_0": "That’s how the brahmins insult us.”",
    "ai-dn27:4.1_0": "“Actually, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins are forgetting their tradition when they say this to you.",
    "ai-dn27:4.2_0": "‘Only brahmins are the first caste; other castes are inferior.",
    "ai-dn27:4.3_0": "Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.",
    "ai-dn27:4.4_0": "Only brahmins are purified, not others.",
    "ai-dn27:4.5_0": "Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’",
    "ai-dn27:4.6_0": "For brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breast-feeding.",
    "ai-dn27:4.7_0": "Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say:",
    "ai-dn27:4.8_0": "‘Only brahmins are the first caste; other castes are inferior.",
    "ai-dn27:4.9_0": "Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.",

    "ai-dn27:4.12_0": "They misrepresent the brahmins, speak falsely, and make much bad karma.",
    "ai-dn27:5.0_0": "1. Purification in the Four Castes ",
    "ai-dn27:5.1_0": "Vāseṭṭha, there are these four castes:",
    "ai-dn27:5.2_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-dn27:5.3_0": "Some aristocrats kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.",
    "ai-dn27:5.4_0": "These things are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are dark deeds with dark results, criticized by sensible people. Such things are seen in some aristocrats.",
    "ai-dn27:5.5_0": "and Vāseṭṭha.",
    "ai-dn27:5.6_0": "and merchants.",
    "ai-dn27:5.7_0": "and workers.",
    "ai-dn27:5.8_0": "And so these things are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such.",
    "ai-dn27:5.9_0": "dark results;",
    "ai-dn27:5.10_0": "a worker will find out.",
    "ai-dn27:6.1_0": "But some aristocrats refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re content, kind-hearted, with right view.",
    "ai-dn27:6.2_0": "These things are skillful, blameless, to be cultivated, worthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are bright deeds with bright results, praised by sensible people. Such things are seen in some aristocrats.",
    "ai-dn27:6.3_0": "and Vāseṭṭha.",
    "ai-dn27:6.4_0": "and merchants.",
    "ai-dn27:6.5_0": "and workers.",
    "ai-dn27:6.6_0": "She’s content, kind-hearted, and has right view.",
    "ai-dn27:6.7_0": "These things are skillful, blameless, to be cultivated, worthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are bright deeds with bright results, praised by sensible people.",
    "ai-dn27:6.8_0": "a worker will find out.",
    "ai-dn27:7.1_0": "Both these things occur like this, mixed up in these four castes—the dark and the bright, that which is praised and that which is criticized by sensible people. Yet of this the brahmins say:",
    "ai-dn27:7.2_0": "‘Only brahmins are the first caste; other castes are inferior.",
    "ai-dn27:7.3_0": "Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.",
    "ai-dn27:7.4_0": "Only brahmins are purified, not others.",
    "ai-dn27:7.5_0": "Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’",
    "ai-dn27:7.6_0": "Sensible people don’t acknowledge this.",
    "ai-dn27:7.7_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-dn27:7.8_0": "Because any mendicant from these four castes who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is said to be foremost by virtue of principle, not without principle.",
    "ai-dn27:7.9_0": "For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next.",
    "ai-dn27:7.10_0": "And here’s a way to understand how this is so.",
    "ai-dn27:8.1_0": "King Pasenadi of Kosala knows that",
    "ai-dn27:8.2_0": "the ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans.",
    "ai-dn27:8.3_0": "And the Sakyans are his vassals.",
    "ai-dn27:8.4_0": "The Sakyans show deference to King Pasenadi by bowing down, rising up, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.",
    "ai-dn27:8.5_0": "Now, King Pasenadi shows the same kind of deference to the Realized One. But he doesn’t think: ‘The ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born.",
    "ai-dn27:8.6_0": "He is powerful, I am weak.",
    "ai-dn27:8.7_0": "He is handsome, I am ugly.",
    "ai-dn27:8.8_0": "He is influential, I am insignificant.’",
    "ai-dn27:8.9_0": "Rather, in showing such deference to the Realized One he is only honoring, respecting, and venerating principle.",
    "ai-dn27:8.10_0": "And here’s another way to understand how principle is the first thing for people in both this life and the next.",
    "ai-dn27:9.1_0": "Vāseṭṭha, you have different births, names, and clans, and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from different families.",
    "ai-dn27:9.2_0": "When they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics, followers of the Sakyan.",
    "ai-dn27:9.3_0": "But only when someone has faith in the Realized One—settled, rooted, and planted deep, strong, not to be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world—is it appropriate for them to say:",
    "ai-dn27:9.4_0": "‘I am the Buddha’s true-born child, born from his mouth, born of principle, created by principle, heir to principle.’",
    "ai-dn27:9.5_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-dn27:9.6_0": "For these are terms for the Realized One: ‘the embodiment of truth’, and ‘the embodiment of holiness’, and ‘the one who has become the truth’, and ‘the one who has become holy’.",
    "ai-dn27:10.1_0": "There comes a time when, Vāseṭṭha, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts.",
    "ai-dn27:10.2_0": "As it contracts, most sentient beings migrate to the realm of streaming radiance.",
    "ai-dn27:10.3_0": "There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.",
    "ai-dn27:10.4_0": "There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands.",
    "ai-dn27:10.5_0": "As the cosmos expands, sentient beings mostly pass away from that host of radiant deities and come back to this realm.",
    "ai-dn27:10.6_0": "Here they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.",
    "ai-dn27:11.0_0": "2. Solid Nectar Appears ",
    "ai-dn27:11.1_0": "But the single mass of water at that time was utterly dark.",
    "ai-dn27:11.2_0": "The moon and sun were not found, nor were stars and constellations, day and night, months and fortnights, years and seasons, or male and female. Beings were simply known as ‘beings’.",
    "ai-dn27:11.3_0": "After a very long period had passed, solid nectar curdled in the water.",
    "ai-dn27:11.4_0": "It appeared just like the curd on top of hot milk-rice as it cools.",
    "ai-dn27:11.5_0": "so too the Buddha appeared to him.",
    "ai-dn27:11.6_0": "It was beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter.",
    "ai-dn27:11.7_0": "And it was as sweet as pure manuka honey.",
    "ai-dn27:11.8_0": "so I lived like this.",
    "ai-dn27:11.9_0": "Now, one of those beings was reckless.",
    "ai-dn27:11.10_0": "Thinking, ‘Oh my, what might this be?’ they tasted the solid nectar with their finger.",
    "ai-dn27:11.11_0": "They enjoyed it, and craving was born in them.",
    "ai-dn27:11.12_0": "And other beings, following that being’s example, tasted solid nectar with their fingers.",
    "ai-dn27:11.13_0": "They too enjoyed it, and craving was born in them.",
    "ai-dn27:12.0_0": "3. The Moon and Sun Appear ",
    "ai-dn27:12.1_0": "Then those beings started to eat the solid nectar with their hands.",
    "ai-dn27:12.2_0": "But when they did this",
    "ai-dn27:12.3_0": "their luminosity vanished.",
    "ai-dn27:12.4_0": "And with the vanishing of their luminosity the moon and sun appeared,",
    "ai-dn27:12.5_0": "stars and constellations appeared,",
    "ai-dn27:12.6_0": "days and nights were distinguished,",
    "ai-dn27:12.7_0": "and so were months and fortnights,",
    "ai-dn27:12.8_0": "and years and seasons.",
    "ai-dn27:12.9_0": "To this extent the world had evolved once more.",
    "ai-dn27:13.1_0": "Then those beings eating the solid nectar, with that as their food and nourishment, remained for a very long time.",
    "ai-dn27:13.2_0": "But so long as they ate that solid nectar, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance;",
    "ai-dn27:13.3_0": "sentient beings are ugly, beautiful, and ugly.",
    "ai-dn27:13.4_0": "And the ugly beings, coveting the beautiful ones, committed to this:",
    "ai-dn27:13.5_0": "‘I’m not even more splendid.",
    "ai-dn27:13.6_0": "And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the solid nectar vanish.",
    "ai-dn27:13.7_0": "They gathered together and bemoaned,",
    "ai-dn27:13.8_0": "They gathered together and bemoaned,",
    "ai-dn27:13.9_0": "‘Oh, if only a taste!’",
    "ai-dn27:13.10_0": "And even today when people get something tasty they say:",
    "ai-dn27:13.11_0": "‘Oh, if only a taste!’",
    "ai-dn27:13.12_0": "You understand the origin of the local terminology and don’t understand the meaning of anything.",
    "ai-dn27:14.0_0": "4. Ground-Sprouts ",
    "ai-dn27:14.1_0": "When the solid nectar had vanished, ground-sprouts appeared to those beings.",
    "ai-dn27:14.2_0": "They appeared just like mushrooms.",
    "ai-dn27:14.3_0": "They were beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter.",
    "ai-dn27:14.4_0": "And they were as sweet as pure manuka honey.",
    "ai-dn27:14.5_0": "Then those beings started to eat the ground-sprouts.",
    "ai-dn27:14.6_0": "And they ate their way.",
    "ai-dn27:14.7_0": "But so long as they ate those ground-sprouts, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance;",

    "ai-dn27:14.12.0_0": "5. Bursting Pods ",
    "ai-dn27:14.13_0": "When the ground-sprouts had vanished, bursting pods appeared, like the fruit of the kadam tree.",
    "ai-dn27:14.14_0": "It was beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter.",
    "ai-dn27:14.15_0": "And they were as sweet as pure manuka honey.",
    "ai-dn27:15.1_0": "Then those beings started to eat the bursting pods.",
    "ai-dn27:15.2_0": "And they ate their way.",
    "ai-dn27:15.3_0": "But so long as they ate those bursting pods, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance;",

    "ai-dn27:15.12_0": "You understand the origin of the local terminology and don’t understand the meaning of anything.",
    "ai-dn27:16.0_0": "6. Ripe Untilled Rice ",
    "ai-dn27:16.1_0": "When the bursting pods had vanished, ripe untilled rice appeared to those beings. It had no powder or husk, pure and fragrant, with only the rice-grain.",
    "ai-dn27:16.2_0": "What they took for supper in the evening, by the morning had grown back and ripened.",
    "ai-dn27:16.3_0": "And what they took for breakfast in the morning had grown back and ripened by the evening,",
    "ai-dn27:16.4_0": "so the cutting didn’t show.",
    "ai-dn27:16.5_0": "Then those beings eating rice and porridge, with nourishment, remained for a very long time.",

    "ai-dn27:16.7_0": "But so long as they ate that ripe untilled rice, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance. And female characteristics appeared on women, while male characteristics appeared on men.",
    "ai-dn27:16.8_0": "Women spent too much time gazing at men, and men at women.",
    "ai-dn27:16.9_0": "They became lustful, and their bodies burned with fever.",
    "ai-dn27:16.10_0": "Due to this fever they had sex with each other.",
    "ai-dn27:16.11_0": "Those who saw them having sex pelted them with dirt, ashes, or cow-dung, saying,",

    "ai-dn27:16.13_0": "‘How can a being such a thing?’",

    "ai-dn27:17.4_0": "they started to make buildings to hide their immoral deeds.",

    "ai-dn27:17.7_0": "Why don’t I gather rice for supper and breakfast all at once?’",

    "ai-dn27:17.11_0": "‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for supper and breakfast all at once.’",
    "ai-dn27:17.12_0": "So that being, following their example, gathered rice for two days all at once, thinking of them.",

    "ai-dn27:17.13_0": "Then one of those beings went to that being and said,",
    "ai-dn27:17.14_0": "‘Come, let’s go to rice for seven days.’",
    "ai-dn27:17.15_0": "‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for two days all at once.’",
    "ai-dn27:17.16_0": "So that being, following their example, gathered rice for four days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’",

    "ai-dn27:17.18_0": "‘Come, let’s go to rice for seven days.’",
    "ai-dn27:17.19_0": "‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for four days all at once.’",
    "ai-dn27:17.20_0": "So that being, following their example, gathered rice for eight days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’",
    "ai-dn27:17.21_0": "But when they started to store up rice to eat,",
    "ai-dn27:17.22_0": "the rice grains became wrapped in powder and husk,",
    "ai-dn27:17.23_0": "And there was also no portion of wisdom.",
    "ai-dn27:18.0_0": "9. Dividing the Fields ",
    "ai-dn27:18.1_0": "Then those beings gathered together,",
    "ai-dn27:18.2_0": "‘Oh, how wicked things have appeared among beings!",
    "ai-dn27:18.3_0": "For we used to be mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and we remained like that for a very long time.",

    "ai-dn27:18.10_0": "But due to bad, unskillful things among us, the savory nectar vanished,",
    "ai-dn27:18.11_0": "They appeared to the ground-sprouts,",

    "ai-dn27:18.13_0": "We’ll then eat your wrap garments on the ground.",
    "ai-dn27:18.14_0": "Then we ate in the dark. It was long since we remained for a long time.",

    "ai-dn27:18.18_0": "We’ll then eat this broad rock.",
    "ai-dn27:18.19_0": "Then we ate in the dark. It was long since we remained for a long time.",
    "ai-dn27:18.20_0": "the bursting pods vanished,",
    "ai-dn27:18.21_0": "When the bursting pods had vanished, ripe untilled rice appeared to its fruit, pure and fragrant, with only the rice-grain.",

    "ai-dn27:18.23_0": "And what they took for breakfast in the morning had grown back and ripened by the evening,",
    "ai-dn27:18.24_0": "for wisdom.",
    "ai-dn27:18.25_0": "We ate the rice porridge and barley, and we remained for a very long time.",
    "ai-dn27:18.26_0": "and now the rice grains have become wrapped in powder and husk, it doesn’t grow back after reaping, the cutting shows, and the rice stands in clumps.",
    "ai-dn27:18.27_0": "We’d better divide up the rice and set boundaries.’",
    "ai-dn27:18.28_0": "So that’s what they did.",
