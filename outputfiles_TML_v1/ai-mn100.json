    "ai-mn100:3.1_0": "Now at that time the brahmin student Saṅgārava was residing in Caṇḍalakappa. He was young, newly tonsured; he was sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philogy and gramar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.",
    "ai-mn100:3.2_0": "Hearing Dhanañjānī’s exclamation,",
    "ai-mn100:3.3_0": "he said to her,",
    "ai-mn100:3.4_0": "“The brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī is a disgrace! Though brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas are found, she praises that shaveling, that fake ascetic.”",
    "ai-mn100:3.5_0": "“But my little dear, you don’t understand the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.",

    "ai-mn100:9.6_0": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace.",
