    "ai-mn92:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern Āpaṇas together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern Āpaṇas named Āpaṇa.",
    "ai-mn92:2.1_0": "The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard:",
    "ai-mn92:2.2_0": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.",
    "ai-mn92:2.3_0": "He has this good reputation:",
    "ai-mn92:2.4_0": "‘He is indeed a Master, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Master, the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn92:2.5_0": "With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others.",
    "ai-mn92:2.6_0": "They teach Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.",
    "ai-mn92:2.7_0": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.”",
    "ai-mn92:3.1_0": "Then Keṇiya the matted-hair ascetic went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.",
    "ai-mn92:3.2_0": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.",
    "ai-mn92:3.3_0": "The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching,",
    "ai-mn92:3.4_0": "Then Keṇiya said,",
    "ai-mn92:3.5_0": "“Good Gotama, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”",
    "ai-mn92:3.6_0": "When he said this, the Buddha said to Keṇiya,",
    "ai-mn92:3.7_0": "“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.”",
    "ai-mn92:3.8_0": "For a second time ...",
    "ai-mn92:3.9_0": "but repeated his invitation a second time.",
    "ai-mn92:3.10_0": "Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”",

    "ai-mn92:3.12_0": "“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.”",

    "ai-mn92:3.15_0": "Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”",
    "ai-mn92:3.16_0": "And the Buddha consented by remaining silent.",
    "ai-mn92:4.1_0": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage.",
    "ai-mn92:4.1_1": "He addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members,",
    "ai-mn92:4.2_0": "“Gentlemen, please listen.",

    "ai-mn92:4.4_0": "Please help me with the preparations.”",
    "ai-mn92:4.5_0": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats.",
    "ai-mn92:4.6_0": "Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself.",
    "ai-mn92:5.1_0": "Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philogy and gramar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymns.",
    "ai-mn92:6.1_0": "Now at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela.",

    "ai-mn92:6.3_0": "He saw the preparations going on,",
    "ai-mn92:7.1_0": "and said to Keṇiya,",
    "ai-mn92:7.2_0": "“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?”",
    "ai-mn92:8.1_0": "“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming.",
    "ai-mn92:8.2_0": "Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice.",
    "ai-mn92:8.3_0": "The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.",
    "ai-mn92:8.4_0": "He has this good reputation:",
    "ai-mn92:8.5_0": "‘He is indeed a Master, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Master, the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn92:8.6_0": "He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”",
    "ai-mn92:9.1_0": "“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”",
    "ai-mn92:9.2_0": "“I said ‘the awakened one’.”",
    "ai-mn92:9.3_0": "“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”",
    "ai-mn92:9.4_0": "“I said ‘the awakened one’.”",

    "ai-mn92:10.3_0": "The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.",
    "ai-mn92:10.4_0": "If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch.",
    "ai-mn92:10.5_0": "He has the following seven treasures:",
    "ai-mn92:10.6_0": "The wheel-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure.",
    "ai-mn92:10.7_0": "He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.",
    "ai-mn92:10.8_0": "After conquering this land girt by sea, I reigned by principle, without rod or sword.",
    "ai-mn92:10.9_0": "But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.”",
    "ai-mn92:11.1_0": "“But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”",
    "ai-mn92:11.2_0": "When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said,",
    "ai-mn92:11.3_0": "“There, Mister Sela, at that line of blue forest.”",
    "ai-mn92:12.1_0": "Then Sela, together with his students, approached the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn92:12.2_0": "He said to his students,",
    "ai-mn92:12.3_0": "“Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently.",
    "ai-mn92:12.4_0": "For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone.",
    "ai-mn92:12.5_0": "When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt.",
    "ai-mn92:12.6_0": "Wait until I’ve finished speaking.”",
    "ai-mn92:13.1_0": "Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.",
    "ai-mn92:13.2_0": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.",
    "ai-mn92:13.3_0": "and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.",
    "ai-mn92:13.4_0": "He saw all of them except for two,",
    "ai-mn92:13.5_0": "They have doubts about the thirty-two marks,",
    "ai-mn92:13.6_0": "silken cloth and the tongue let alone pile.",
    "ai-mn92:13.7_0": "Then it occurred to the Buddha:",
    "ai-mn92:13.8_0": "“Sela sees all the marks except for two,",
    "ai-mn92:13.9_0": "They have doubts about the thirty-two marks,",
    "ai-mn92:13.10_0": "silken cloth and clay?”",
    "ai-mn92:14.1_0": "The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his retracted private parts.",
    "ai-mn92:14.2_0": "Then the Buddha split the tongue took it together and chopped them.",
    "ai-mn92:14.2_1": "he studies, neither;",
    "ai-mn92:14.2_2": "There’s no lamp, tangled with teeth,",
    "ai-mn92:15.1_0": "Then Sela thought,",
    "ai-mn92:15.2_0": "“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.",
    "ai-mn92:15.3_0": "But I don’t know whether or not he is an awakened one.",
    "ai-mn92:15.4_0": "I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said,",
    "ai-mn92:15.5_0": "‘Those who are perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised.’",
    "ai-mn92:15.6_0": "Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?”",
    "ai-mn92:15.7_0": "Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:",
