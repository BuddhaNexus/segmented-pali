    "ai-mn77:2.2_0": "They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.",
    "ai-mn77:3.1_0": "Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for alms.",

    "ai-mn77:3.3_0": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.",
    "ai-mn77:3.4_0": "Why don’t I visit the wanderer Pakudha at Sakuludāyī?”",
    "ai-mn77:4.1_0": "So the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.",
    "ai-mn77:4.2_0": "Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as",
