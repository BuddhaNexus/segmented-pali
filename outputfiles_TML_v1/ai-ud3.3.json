    "ai-ud3.3:1.4_0": "At that, those visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.",
    "ai-ud3.3:2.1_0": "Then he addressed Ānanda,",
    "ai-ud3.3:2.2_0": "“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”",
    "ai-ud3.3:2.3_0": "“Sir, those five hundred mendicants headed by Yasoja have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.",
    "ai-ud3.3:2.4_0": "It’s those visiting mendicants who, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.”",

    "ai-ud3.3:2.6_0": "the teacher summons them.",
    "ai-ud3.3:3.1_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda.",
    "ai-ud3.3:3.1_1": "They said to them,",
    "ai-ud3.3:3.2_0": "“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”",

    "ai-ud3.3:14.1_0": "And for a third time, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha all that had happened, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-ud3.3:14.2_0": "“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the second watch of the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long.",
