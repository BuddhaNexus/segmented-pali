    "ai-mn36:2.1_0": "Now at that time in the morning the Buddha, being properly dressed, took his bowl and robe, wishing to enter Vesālī for alms.",
    "ai-mn36:3.1_0": "Then as Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was going for a walk he approached the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.",
    "ai-mn36:3.2_0": "Venerable Ānanda saw him coming off in the distance,",
    "ai-mn36:3.3_0": "and said to him,",
    "ai-mn36:3.4_0": "“Sir, Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, is coming. He’s a debater and clever speaker regarded as holy by many people.",
    "ai-mn36:3.5_0": "He wants to discredit the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.",
    "ai-mn36:3.6_0": "Please, sir, sit for a moment out of compassion.”",
    "ai-mn36:3.7_0": "The Buddha sat on the seat spread out",

    "ai-mn36:3.8_2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn36:4.1_0": "“Master Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing physical endurance, without developing the mind.",
    "ai-mn36:4.2_0": "They suffer painful physical feelings.",
    "ai-mn36:4.3_0": "This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind.",
    "ai-mn36:4.4_0": "Their mind was subject to the body, and the body had power over it.",
    "ai-mn36:4.5_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn36:4.6_0": "Because their mind was not developed.",

    "ai-mn36:5.1_0": "“But Aggivessana, what have you heard about the development of physical endurance?”",

    "ai-mn36:5.4_0": "They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when asked. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal.",
    "ai-mn36:5.5_0": "They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer.",
    "ai-mn36:5.6_0": "They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and two mouthfuls.",

    "ai-mn36:6.3_0": "Sometimes they eat a variety of luxury foods and drink a variety of luxury beverages.",
    "ai-mn36:6.4_0": "They gather their body’s strength, build it up, and get fat.”",
    "ai-mn36:6.5_0": "“What they earlier gave up, they later got back. That is how there is the increase and decrease of this body.",

    "ai-mn36:6.7_0": "When Saccaka was questioned by the Buddha about development of the mind, he was unable to answer.",
    "ai-mn36:7.1_0": "Then the Buddha said to Saccaka,",
    "ai-mn36:7.2_0": "“The development of physical endurance that you have described is not the legitimate development of physical endurance in the noble one’s training.",
    "ai-mn36:7.3_0": "And since you don’t even understand the development of physical endurance, how can you possibly understand the development of the mind?",
    "ai-mn36:7.4_0": "Still, they have not developed their mind, and they have developed physical endurance.",
    "ai-mn36:7.5_0": "listen and attend closely, I will speak.",

    "ai-mn36:8.3_0": "When they experience pleasant feeling they become full of lust for it.",
    "ai-mn36:8.4_0": "The pleasant feeling ceases.",
    "ai-mn36:8.5_0": "And when it ceases, a painful feeling arises.",
    "ai-mn36:8.6_0": "When they suffer painful feeling, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.",
    "ai-mn36:8.7_0": "Because their physical endurance is undeveloped, pleasant feelings occupy the mind. And because their mind is undeveloped, painful feelings occupy the mind.",
    "ai-mn36:8.8_0": "Someone whose mind is occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is undeveloped in physical endurance and in mind.",
    "ai-mn36:9.1_0": "And how is someone developed in physical endurance and mind?",
    "ai-mn36:9.2_0": "Take an educated noble disciple who has a pleasant feeling.",
    "ai-mn36:9.3_0": "When they experience pleasant feeling they don’t become full of lust for it.",
    "ai-mn36:9.4_0": "The pleasant feeling ceases.",
    "ai-mn36:9.5_0": "And when it ceases, a painful feeling arises.",
    "ai-mn36:9.6_0": "When they suffer painful feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.",
    "ai-mn36:9.7_0": "Because their physical endurance is developed, pleasant feelings don’t occupy the mind. And because their mind is developed, painful feelings don’t occupy the mind.",
    "ai-mn36:9.8_0": "Someone whose mind is not occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is developed in physical endurance and in mind.",
    "ai-mn36:9.8_1": "This is how someone is developed in physical endurance and mind.”",
    "ai-mn36:10.1_0": "“I’m quite confident that Master Gotama,",
    "ai-mn36:10.2_0": "is developed in physical endurance and in mind.”",
    "ai-mn36:10.3_0": "“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, Aggivessana.",
    "ai-mn36:10.4_0": "Nevertheless, I will answer you.",
    "ai-mn36:10.5_0": "Ever since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, it has not been possible for any pleasant or painful feeling to occupy my mind.”",
    "ai-mn36:11.1_0": "“Surely you must have had feelings so pleasant or so painful that they could occupy your mind?",

    "ai-mn36:12.1_0": "“How could I not, Aggivessana?",
    "ai-mn36:12.2_0": "Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:",
    "ai-mn36:12.3_0": "‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.",
    "ai-mn36:12.4_0": "It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.",
    "ai-mn36:12.5_0": "Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?’",
    "ai-mn36:13.1_0": "Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.",
    "ai-mn36:13.2_0": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace.",
    "ai-mn36:13.2_1": "I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn36:13.3_0": "he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’",
    "ai-mn36:13.4_0": "Āḷāra Kālāma replied,",
    "ai-mn36:13.5_0": "‘Rejoice, venerable!",
    "ai-mn36:13.6_0": "This is the teaching that a man who has realized with his own insight.’",

    "ai-mn36:13.11_0": "Āḷāra Kālāma is knowing and seeing this teaching.’",
    "ai-mn36:13.12_0": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma.",
    "ai-mn36:13.12_1": "I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn36:13.13_0": "‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent did he realize this teaching with his own insight?’",
    "ai-mn36:13.14_0": "When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.",
    "ai-mn36:13.15_0": "I thought,",
    "ai-mn36:13.16_0": "‘No, Āḷāra Kālāma, I have faith.",

    "ai-mn36:13.20_0": "and wisdom; I too have these things.",
    "ai-mn36:13.21_0": "Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’",
    "ai-mn36:13.22_0": "I soon realized that teaching, and live having achieved it.",
    "ai-mn36:14.1_0": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma.",
    "ai-mn36:14.1_1": "I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn36:14.2_0": "‘Reverend Kālāma, had realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’",
    "ai-mn36:14.3_0": "‘He had, reverend.’",
    "ai-mn36:14.4_0": "‘I too, reverend, have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’",

    "ai-mn36:14.10_0": "I am like you and you are like me.",
    "ai-mn36:14.11_0": "Come now, let’s both take this community of us.’",
    "ai-mn36:14.12_0": "And that is how my teacher Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his student, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.",
    "ai-mn36:14.13_0": "I thought,",
    "ai-mn36:14.14_0": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in dimension of nothingness.’",
    "ai-mn36:14.15_0": "So I left without wearing away.",
    "ai-mn36:15.1_0": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and approached Uddaka.",
    "ai-mn36:15.1_1": "I approached Uddaka and son of Rāma, and said to him,",

    "ai-mn36:16.1_0": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā.",

    "ai-mn36:33.3_0": "So I ate some solid food.",
    "ai-mn36:33.4_0": "Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,",

    "ai-mn36:33.6_0": "But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,",
    "ai-mn36:33.7_0": "‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’",
    "ai-mn36:34.1_0": "After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.",

    "ai-mn36:35-37.6_0": "Aggivessana, I don’t occupy my mind.",
    "ai-mn36:38.1_0": "When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.",
