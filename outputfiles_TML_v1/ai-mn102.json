    "ai-mn102:2.7_0": "that’s where they get.",
    "ai-mn102:2.8_0": "But some assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being, while others propose extinguishment in the present life.",
    "ai-mn102:2.9_0": "Thus they assert an existent self that is sound after death; or they assert the annihilation of an existing being; or they propose extinguishment in the present life.",
    "ai-mn102:2.10_0": "In this way five become three, and three become five.",
    "ai-mn102:2.11_0": "This is the passage for recitation of the five and three.",
    "ai-mn102:3.1_0": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death describe it as having form, or being formless, or both having form and being formless, or neither having form nor being formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception.",

    "ai-mn102:6.1_0": "So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death.",
    "ai-mn102:6.2_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn102:6.3_0": "Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of non-perception is peaceful and sublime.",

    "ai-mn102:9.2_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn102:9.3_0": "Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of neither perception nor non-perception is peaceful and sublime.",

    "ai-mn102:11.2_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn102:11.3_0": "Because all of those ascetics and brahmins only assert their attachment to moving up to a higher realm:",
