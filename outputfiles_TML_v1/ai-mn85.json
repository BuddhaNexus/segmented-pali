    "ai-mn85:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.",
    "ai-mn85:2.1_0": "Now at that time a new stilt longhouse named Pink Lotus had recently been constructed for Prince Bodhi. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.",
    "ai-mn85:3.1_0": "Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sañjikāputta,",
    "ai-mn85:3.2_0": "“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn85:3.2_1": "Then the Buddha’s head and your feet were healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-mn85:3.3_0": "if he is healthy, strong, and living at ease.",
    "ai-mn85:3.4_0": "And then say,",
    "ai-mn85:3.5_0": "might accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”",
    "ai-mn85:4.1_0": "“Yes, sir,” Sañjikāputta replied. He did as Prince Bodhi asked,",
    "ai-mn85:4.1_1": "exchanged pleasantries with him,",
    "ai-mn85:4.2_0": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.",
    "ai-mn85:4.2_1": "Sañjayaputta said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn85:4.3_0": "“The Prince is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-mn85:4.4_0": "And she asks whether",

    "ai-mn85:4.6_0": "And the Buddha consented by remaining silent.",
    "ai-mn85:4.7_0": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañjikāputta got up from his seat, went to the Prince,",
    "ai-mn85:4.7_1": "and said to Prince Bodhi,",

    "ai-mn85:5.1_0": "And when the night had passed Prince Bodhi had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. He also had the Pink Lotus longhouse spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he said to Sañjikāputta,",

    "ai-mn85:5.5_0": "that the meal was ready.",
    "ai-mn85:6.1_0": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s home.",
    "ai-mn85:7.1_0": "The Prince was standing outside the gateway, waiting for the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn85:7.2_0": "Seeing the Buddha coming off in the distance,",

    "ai-mn85:7.4_0": "But the Buddha stopped by the last step of the staircase.",
    "ai-mn85:7.5_0": "Then Prince Bodhi said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:7.6_0": "“Sir, please wear the cloth,",
    "ai-mn85:7.7_0": "It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”",
    "ai-mn85:7.8_0": "But the Buddha remained silent.",
    "ai-mn85:7.9_0": "Citta asked him a second",
    "ai-mn85:7.10_0": "and a third time, Prince Bodhi said to him,",

    "ai-mn85:7.17_0": "The Realized One has compassion for future generations.”",
    "ai-mn85:8.1_0": "So Prince Bodhi had the cloth folded up and the seats spread out upstairs in the longhouse.",
    "ai-mn85:8.2_0": "Then the Buddha ascended the longhouse and sat on the seats spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.",

    "ai-mn85:9.2_0": "When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat to one side,",
    "ai-mn85:9.3_0": "and said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:9.4_0": "“Sir, this is what I think:",
    "ai-mn85:9.5_0": "‘I won’t achieve pleasure, pleasure is gained through pain.",
    "ai-mn85:10.1_0": "“Prince, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought:",
    "ai-mn85:10.2_0": "‘It’s not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’",
    "ai-mn85:11.1_0": "Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.",
    "ai-mn85:11.2_0": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace.",
    "ai-mn85:11.2_1": "I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:11.3_0": "he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’",
    "ai-mn85:11.4_0": "Āḷāra Kālāma replied,",
    "ai-mn85:11.5_0": "‘Rejoice, venerable!",
    "ai-mn85:11.6_0": "This is the teaching that a man who has realized with his own insight.’",
    "ai-mn85:11.7_0": "So I quickly learn that Dhamma.",
    "ai-mn85:11.8_0": "There, prince, just a little bit of dirt under your fingernail, with the nail, and the knees. I say they don’t know or see or give rise to others.",
    "ai-mn85:11.9_0": "I thought,",
    "ai-mn85:11.10_0": "‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”",
    "ai-mn85:11.11_0": "Āḷāra Kālāma is knowing and seeing this teaching.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.1_0": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma.",
    "ai-mn85:12.1_1": "I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:12.2_0": "‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent did he realize this teaching with his own insight?’",
    "ai-mn85:12.3_0": "When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.",
    "ai-mn85:12.4_0": "I thought,",

    "ai-mn85:12.9_0": "wisdom is mine.",
    "ai-mn85:12.10_0": "Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’",
    "ai-mn85:12.11_0": "I soon realized that teaching, and live having achieved it.",
    "ai-mn85:12.12_0": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma.",
    "ai-mn85:12.12_1": "I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:12.13_0": "‘Reverend Kālāma, had realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’",
    "ai-mn85:12.14_0": "‘He had, reverend.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.15_0": "‘I too, reverend, have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.16_0": "‘You’re fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate,",
    "ai-mn85:12.17_0": "to see a venerable such as yourself.",
    "ai-mn85:12.18_0": "So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it.",
    "ai-mn85:12.19_0": "The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.",
    "ai-mn85:12.20_0": "So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.",
    "ai-mn85:12.21_0": "I am like you and you are like me.",
    "ai-mn85:12.22_0": "Come now, let’s both take this community of us.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.23_0": "And that is how my teacher Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his student, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.",
    "ai-mn85:12.24_0": "I thought,",
    "ai-mn85:12.25_0": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in dimension of nothingness.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.26_0": "So I left without exception,",
    "ai-mn85:12.27_0": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and went to see him.",
    "ai-mn85:12.27_1": "I approached Uddaka and son of Rāma, and said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:12.28_0": "he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.29_0": "Uddaka replied,",

    "ai-mn85:28.7_0": "my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,",
    "ai-mn85:28.8_0": "The cow-dung is like a cow",
    "ai-mn85:28.8_1": "In the same way, when I tried to relieve my food,",
    "ai-mn85:28.9_0": "They’re like a drop of water falling in a deep lake fed from the water.",
    "ai-mn85:28.9_1": "In the same way, when I travered by harnessed to profound a profoundation,",
    "ai-mn85:28.10_0": "It’s like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok;",

    "ai-mn85:28.13_1": "Evercome by my limbs, the limbs became dragged down by my limbs, and the cloth fell off.",
    "ai-mn85:29.1_0": "Then some people saw me and said, ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’",
    "ai-mn85:29.2_0": "Some said, ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’",

    "ai-mn85:34-37.1_0": "After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I took hold of my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities,",

    "ai-mn85:45.3_0": "It was just like a lotus pond with lotuses born and grown in water: some remain submerged in the water without rising out of it, others reach the surface of the water, and others still rise out of the water without being touched by it.",
