    "ai-mn129:3.1_0": "A fool experiences three kinds of suffering and sadness in the present life.",
    "ai-mn129:3.2_0": "Suppose a fool is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad,",

    "ai-mn129:3.8_0": "This is the first kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in the present life.",
    "ai-mn129:4.1_0": "Furthermore, a fool sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—",
    "ai-mn129:4.2_0": "whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.",

    "ai-mn129:5.2_0": "It’s like when the mountain peak pulled over a large mountain peak, full to the ground at the crack of dawn.",

    "ai-mn129:8.21_0": "“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!”",
    "ai-mn129:9.1_0": "Then the Buddha, picking up a lump of living creature, addressed the mendicants:",
    "ai-mn129:9.2_0": "“What do you think, mendicants?",
    "ai-mn129:9.3_0": "Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?”",
    "ai-mn129:9.4_0": "“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.”",
    "ai-mn129:9.5_0": "“In the same way, compared to the suffering in hell, the pain and distress experienced by that man due to being struck with three hundred spears doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.",
    "ai-mn129:10.1_0": "Then the wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion.",
    "ai-mn129:10.2_0": "They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest.",
    "ai-mn129:10.3_0": "And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.",

    "ai-mn129:13.1_0": "They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. ...",
    "ai-mn129:13.2_0": "And with that, they eliminate pain.",
    "ai-mn129:14.1_0": "They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. ...",
    "ai-mn129:14.2_0": "And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.",
    "ai-mn129:15.1_0": "The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them into a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing.",
    "ai-mn129:15.2_0": "Then they emerged from it.",
    "ai-mn129:15.3_0": "They’d seek the bottoms above all below, across, everywhere, all around, to be found.",
    "ai-mn129:15.4_0": "And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.",

    "ai-mn129:24.9_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn129:24.10_0": "Because in that place there’s no principled or moral conduct, and no doing what is good and skillful.",
    "ai-mn129:24.11_0": "This is what happens.",

    "ai-mn129:26.2_0": "But such an unlucky throw is trivial compared to",
    "ai-mn129:26.3_0": "the unlucky throw whereby a fool, having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.",
