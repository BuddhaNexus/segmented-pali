    "ai-mn89:2.2_0": "Then he addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,",
    "ai-mn89:2.3_0": "“My good Kārāyana, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.”",
    "ai-mn89:2.4_0": "“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He did so, saying,",
    "ai-mn89:2.5_0": "“The fine carriages are harnessed.",

    "ai-mn89:8.1_2": "The Buddha will open the door.”",
    "ai-mn89:8.2_0": "The king right away presented his sword and turban to Dīgha Kārāyana,",

    "ai-mn89:13.2_0": "I am able to execute, fine, or banish those who are guilty.",
    "ai-mn89:13.3_0": "Yet when I’m sitting in judgment they interrupt me.",
    "ai-mn89:13.4_0": "I don’t get any material possessions.",
    "ai-mn89:13.5_0": "to stop interrupting me and wait until I’ve finished speaking.",
    "ai-mn89:13.6_0": "Yet I interrupt me.",
    "ai-mn89:13.7_0": "But here I see the mendicants",
    "ai-mn89:13.8_0": "While the Buddha is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.",
    "ai-mn89:13.9_0": "Once it so happened that the Buddha was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.",
    "ai-mn89:13.10_0": "Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.",
