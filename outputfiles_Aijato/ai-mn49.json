    "ai-mn49:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-mn49:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
    "ai-mn49:1.3_0": "There he addressed the mendicants:",
    "ai-mn49:1.4_0": "“Yes, mendicants.”",
    "ai-mn49:1.5_0": "“The mendicants replied.",
    "ai-mn49:1.6_0": "The Buddha said to him:",
    "ai-mn49:2.1_0": "“Mendicants, at one time I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.",
    "ai-mn49:2.2_0": "Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:",
    "ai-mn49:2.3_0": "‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’",
    "ai-mn49:3.1_0": "Then I knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking.",
    "ai-mn49:3.2_0": "Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappeared in the presence of the Buddha in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.",
    "ai-mn49:3.2_1": "in that same way, when the Buddha had vanished, he appeared in that Brahmā realm.",
    "ai-mn49:3.3_0": "Baka saw me coming off in the distance",
    "ai-mn49:3.4_0": "and said to me,",
    "ai-mn49:3.5_0": "‘Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir!",
    "ai-mn49:3.6_0": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.",
    "ai-mn49:3.7_0": "This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable.",
    "ai-mn49:3.7_1": "For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’",
    "ai-mn49:4.1_0": "When he had spoken, I said to him,",
    "ai-mn49:4.2_0": "‘Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance!",
    "ai-mn49:4.3_0": "Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable.",
    "ai-mn49:4.4_0": "And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that",
    "ai-mn49:4.5_0": "there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.",
    "ai-mn49:4.6_0": "And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.",
    "ai-mn49:5.1_0": "Then Māra the Wicked, without member of his retinue, pulling me out of that member and said to me,",
    "ai-mn49:5.2_0": "‘Mendicant, mendicant! Don’t attack this one! Don’t attack this one! For this is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.",
    "ai-mn49:5.3_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who criticized and loathed earth, water, air, fire, creatures, gods, the Creator, and Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.4_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.",
    "ai-mn49:5.5_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who praised and approved earth, water, air, fire, creatures, gods, the Creator, and Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.6_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.",
    "ai-mn49:5.7_0": "So, mendicant, I tell you this:",
    "ai-mn49:5.8_0": "please, good sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.9_0": "If you do, then the consequence for you will be like that of a person who, when Lady Luck approaches, wards her off with a staff, or someone who shoves away the ground as they fall down the chasm into hell.",
    "ai-mn49:5.10_0": "please, good sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.11_0": "Do you not see the assembly of Brahmā gathered here?’",
    "ai-mn49:5.12_0": "And that is how Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of Brahmā to me as an example.",
    "ai-mn49:6.1_0": "When he said this, I said to Māra,",
    "ai-mn49:6.2_0": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,",
    "ai-mn49:6.3_0": "“He doesn’t know me.”",
    "ai-mn49:6.4_0": "Māra, you call this.",
    "ai-mn49:6.5_0": "And Brahmā, Brahmā’s assembly, and Brahmā’s retinue have all fallen into your hands; they’re under your sway.",
    "ai-mn49:6.6_0": "For you think,",
    "ai-mn49:6.7_0": "“Maybe this one, too, has fallen into my hands; maybe he’s under my sway!”",
    "ai-mn49:6.8_0": "But I haven’t fallen into your hands; I’m not under your sway.’",
    "ai-mn49:7.1_0": "When I had spoken, Baka the Brahmā said to me,",
    "ai-mn49:7.2_0": "‘But, good sir, what I say is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable is in fact permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. And where I say there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn there is in fact",
    "ai-mn49:7.3_0": "no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.",
    "ai-mn49:7.4_0": "And when I say there’s no other escape beyond this there is in fact no other escape beyond this.",
    "ai-mn49:7.5_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you, mendicant, whose self-mortification lasted as long as your entire life.",
    "ai-mn49:7.6_0": "When there was another escape beyond this they knew it, and when there was no other escape beyond this, they knew it.",
    "ai-mn49:7.7_0": "So, mendicant, I tell you this:",
    "ai-mn49:7.8_0": "“If you’ve seen the escape from any escape beyond, you’ll get weary and frustrated.",
    "ai-mn49:7.9_0": "If you attach to earth, you will lie close to me, in my domain, vulnerable and expendable.",
    "ai-mn49:7.10_0": "If I attach to water ...",
    "ai-mn49:7.11_0": "They rely on straps ...",

    "ai-mn49:8.10_0": "“That’s how powerful is Baka the Brahmā, how illustrious and mighty.”’",
    "ai-mn49:8.11_0": "‘But in what way do you understand my range and my light?’",

    "ai-mn49:9.1_0": "‘A galaxy extends a thousand times as far",

    "ai-mn49:27.4_0": "and didn’t grasp at relishing.’",
    "ai-mn49:28.1_0": "Then Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,",
    "ai-mn49:28.2_0": "‘It’s amazing",

    "ai-mn49:28.4_0": "Though people enjoy continued existence, loving it so much, he has extracted it, root and all.’",
    "ai-mn49:29.1_0": "Then Māra the Wicked, without member of his retinue, pulling me out of that member and said to me,",

    "ai-mn49:29.5_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.",
    "ai-mn49:29.6_0": "They presented, taught, and wished this for their disciples and those gone forth.",
    "ai-mn49:29.7_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.",
    "ai-mn49:29.8_0": "But there have also been other ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.",

    "ai-mn49:29.10_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.",
    "ai-mn49:29.11_0": "So, mendicant, I tell you this:",
    "ai-mn49:29.12_0": "please, good sir, remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life, for this is better left unsaid. Good sir, do not instruct others.’",
    "ai-mn49:30.1_0": "When he said this, I said to Māra,",
    "ai-mn49:30.2_0": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,",

    "ai-mn49:30.9_0": "Those who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened Buddhas.",
    "ai-mn49:30.10_0": "But since I’m perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, I claim my instructions.",
    "ai-mn49:30.11_0": "The Realized One remains as such whether or not he teaches disciples.",
    "ai-mn49:30.12_0": "The Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciples.",
    "ai-mn49:30.13_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn49:30.14_0": "Because the Realized One has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.",
    "ai-mn49:30.15_0": "He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.",
    "ai-mn49:30.16_0": "Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,",
    "ai-mn49:30.17_0": "the Realized One has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.",
    "ai-mn49:30.18_0": "He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.’”",
    "ai-mn49:31.1_0": "And so, because of the silencing of Māra, and because of the invitation of Brahmā, the name of this discussion is “On the Invitation of Brahmā”.",
