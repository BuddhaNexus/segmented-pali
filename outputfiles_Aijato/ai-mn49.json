    "mn49:2.3_0": "‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’",

    "mn49:29.9_0": "They did not present, teach, or wish this for their disciples and those gone forth.",
    "mn49:3.1_0": "Then I knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking.",
    "mn49:3.2_0": "Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappeared in the presence of the Buddha in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.",
    "mn49:3.2_1": "in that same way, when the Buddha had vanished, he appeared in that Brahmā realm.",
    "mn49:3.3_0": "Baka saw me coming off in the distance",

    "mn49:30.10_0": "But since I’m perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, I claim my instructions.",
    "mn49:30.11_0": "The Realized One remains as such whether or not he teaches disciples.",
    "mn49:30.12_0": "The Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciples.",
    "mn49:30.13_0": "Why is that?",
    "mn49:30.14_0": "Because the Realized One has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.",
    "mn49:30.15_0": "He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.",
    "mn49:30.16_0": "Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,",
    "mn49:30.17_0": "the Realized One has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.",
    "mn49:30.18_0": "He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.’”",
    "mn49:30.1_0": "When he said this, I said to Māra,",
    "mn49:30.2_0": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,",
    "mn49:30.3_0": "“He doesn’t know me.”",
    "mn49:30.4_0": "Māra, you call this.",
    "mn49:30.5_0": "You don’t speak to me like this out of compassion,",
    "mn49:30.6_0": "but with no compassion.",
    "mn49:30.7_0": "For you think,",
    "mn49:30.8_0": "“Those who the ascetic Gotama teaches will go beyond my reach.”",
    "mn49:30.9_0": "Those who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened Buddhas.",
    "mn49:31.1_0": "And so, because of the silencing of Māra, and because of the invitation of Brahmā, the name of this discussion is “On the Invitation of Brahmā”.",
    "mn49:31.2_0": "The ninth section on the Brahmā of Brahmā is finished.",
    "mn49:4.1_0": "When he had spoken, I said to him,",
    "mn49:4.2_0": "‘Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance!",
    "mn49:4.3_0": "Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable.",
    "mn49:4.4_0": "And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that",
    "mn49:4.5_0": "there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.",
    "mn49:4.6_0": "And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.",
    "mn49:5.10_0": "please, good sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā.",
    "mn49:5.11_0": "Do you not see the assembly of Brahmā gathered here?’",
    "mn49:5.12_0": "And that is how Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of Brahmā to me as an example.",
    "mn49:5.1_0": "Then Māra the Wicked, without member of his retinue, pulling me out of that member and said to me,",
    "mn49:5.2_0": "‘Mendicant, mendicant! Don’t attack this one! Don’t attack this one! For this is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.",
    "mn49:5.3_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who criticized and loathed earth, water, air, fire, creatures, gods, the Creator, and Brahmā.",
    "mn49:5.4_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.",
    "mn49:5.5_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who praised and approved earth, water, air, fire, creatures, gods, the Creator, and Brahmā.",
    "mn49:5.6_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.",
    "mn49:5.7_0": "So, mendicant, I tell you this:",
    "mn49:5.8_0": "please, good sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā.",
    "mn49:5.9_0": "If you do, then the consequence for you will be like that of a person who, when Lady Luck approaches, wards her off with a staff, or someone who shoves away the ground as they fall down the chasm into hell.",
    "mn49:6.1_0": "When he said this, I said to Māra,",
    "mn49:6.2_0": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,",

    "mn49:6.4_0": "Māra, you call this.",

    "mn49:6.6_0": "For you think,",
    "mn49:6.7_0": "“Maybe this one, too, has fallen into my hands; maybe he’s under my sway!”",
    "mn49:6.8_0": "But I haven’t fallen into your hands; I’m not under your sway.’",
