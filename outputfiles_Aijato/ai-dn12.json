    "ai-dn12:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-dn12:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā.",
    "ai-dn12:1.3_0": "Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality.",
    "ai-dn12:2.1_0": "Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception:",
    "ai-dn12:2.2_0": "“Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another?",
    "ai-dn12:2.3_0": "Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond.",
    "ai-dn12:2.4_0": "That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?”",
    "ai-dn12:3.1_0": "Lohicca heard:",
    "ai-dn12:3.2_0": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Sālavatikā, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.",
    "ai-dn12:3.3_0": "He has this good reputation:",
    "ai-dn12:3.4_0": "‘He is indeed a Master, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Master, the Buddha.",
    "ai-dn12:3.5_0": "With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others.",
    "ai-dn12:3.6_0": "He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely complete and pure.",
    "ai-dn12:3.7_0": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.”",
    "ai-dn12:4.1_0": "Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika,",
    "ai-dn12:4.2_0": "“Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and",
    "ai-dn12:4.2_1": "Going to me, rarely ill or unwell. She asks him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-dn12:4.3_0": "‘Master Gotama, please be healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’",

    "ai-dn12:5.2_0": "“Sir, the brahmin Lohicca is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-dn12:5.3_0": "And she asks whether",
    "ai-dn12:5.4_0": "Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.”",
    "ai-dn12:5.5_0": "And the Buddha consented by remaining silent.",
    "ai-dn12:6.1_0": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Rosika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the brahmin Lohicca,",
    "ai-dn12:6.1_1": "I went to the brahmin Lohicca and said to him,",
    "ai-dn12:6.2_0": "“I gave the Buddha your message,",
    "ai-dn12:6.3_0": "‘Sir, the brahmin Lohicca is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",

    "ai-dn12:6.6_0": "and he accepted.”",
    "ai-dn12:7.1_0": "And when the night had passed Lohicca had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,",

    "ai-dn12:7.2_1": "He should go and inform the ascetic Gotama,",
    "ai-dn12:7.3_0": "‘Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.’”",
    "ai-dn12:7.4_0": "“Yes, sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked.",
    "ai-dn12:7.4_1": "bowed down to the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn12:7.5_0": "He did as he was asked, and",
    "ai-dn12:7.6_0": "“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”",
    "ai-dn12:7.7_0": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.",
    "ai-dn12:8.1_0": "Now, Rosika was following behind the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn12:8.2_0": "and told him of Lohicca’s views, adding,",
    "ai-dn12:8.3_0": "“Sir, someone who has such a harmful misconception:",
    "ai-dn12:8.4_0": "‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else.",

    "ai-dn12:8.10_0": "“Hopefully that’ll happen, Rosika, hopefully that’ll happen.”",
    "ai-dn12:9.1_0": "Then the Buddha went to Lohicca’s home.",
    "ai-dn12:9.1_1": "where he sat down on a prepared seat.",
    "ai-dn12:9.2_0": "Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.",

    "ai-dn12:10.6_0": "He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Sālavatikā and not share them with anyone else.’",
    "ai-dn12:10.7_0": "Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for those whose living depends on you or not?”",

    "ai-dn12:11.2_0": "Does King Pasenadi reign over Kāsī and Kosala?”",
    "ai-dn12:11.3_0": "“Yes, Master Gotama.",

    "ai-dn12:11.6_0": "He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Kāsī and Kosala and not share them with anyone else.’",
    "ai-dn12:11.7_0": "Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for yourself and others whose living depends on King Pasenadi or not?”",

And in addition, there are those who ripen the seeds for rebirth in a heavenly state. The person who spoke like that makes it difficult for them. They’re acting unkindly, their heart is full of hostility, and they have wrong view.",

    "ai-dn12:16.1_0": "Lohicca, there are three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded.",
    "ai-dn12:16.2_0": "When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, substantive, legitimate, and blameless.",
    "ai-dn12:16.3_0": "What are the teachings grouped by three?",
    "ai-dn12:16.4_0": "It’s when some teacher goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, and they have a goal of the ascetic life to homelessness.",
    "ai-dn12:16.5_0": "They teach their disciples:",
    "ai-dn12:16.6_0": "‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’",
    "ai-dn12:16.7_0": "And their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand. They proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.",
    "ai-dn12:16.8_0": "A monk should accuse him like this:",
    "ai-dn12:16.9_0": "‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples",

    "ai-dn12:16.11_0": "they don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.",

    "ai-dn12:17.11_0": "When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is true, substantive, legitimate, and blameless.",
