    "ai-mn90:2.1_0": "Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujuñña on some business.",
    "ai-mn90:2.2_0": "Then he addressed a man,",
    "ai-mn90:2.3_0": "“Please, mister, go to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn90:2.3_1": "He bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-mn90:2.4_0": "King Pasenadi of Kosala bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-mn90:2.5_0": "And then say,",
    "ai-mn90:2.6_0": "‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast.’”",
    "ai-mn90:2.7_0": "“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied.",
    "ai-mn90:2.7_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn90:2.7_2": "He did as Dhanañjāni asked.",
    "ai-mn90:2.8_0": "“Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-mn90:2.9_0": "And she asks whether",
    "ai-mn90:2.10_0": "‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast.’”",
    "ai-mn90:3.1_0": "The sisters Somā and Sakulā heard this.",
    "ai-mn90:3.2_0": "that King Pasenadi of Kosala had finished breakfast.",
    "ai-mn90:3.3_0": "While the meal was being served, they approached the king and said,",
    "ai-mn90:3.4_0": "“Great king, since you are going to the Buddha, please bow in our name with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”",
    "ai-mn90:3.5_0": "‘Sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet. They ask if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’”",
    "ai-mn90:4.1_0": "When he had finished breakfast, King Pasenadi went to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn90:4.1_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn90:4.1_2": "King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the Buddha, and said,",
    "ai-mn90:4.2_0": "“Sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet. They ask if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”",
    "ai-mn90:4.3_0": "“But, great king, couldn’t they get any other messenger?”",
    "ai-mn90:4.4_0": "So Pasenadi explained the circumstances of the message.",
    "ai-mn90:4.5_0": "‘Today King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast.’",
    "ai-mn90:4.6_0": "Then that sister approached me and said,",
    "ai-mn90:4.7_0": "‘Great king, since you are going to the Buddha, please bow in our name with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
    "ai-mn90:4.8_0": "So that’s what he did. He asks for the Buddha’s feet, keeping him on his head, living at ease.”",
    "ai-mn90:4.9_0": "The Buddha said, “May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy, great king.”",
    "ai-mn90:5.1_0": "So the king said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn90:5.2_0": "“I have heard, sir, that the ascetic Gotama says this:",
    "ai-mn90:5.3_0": "‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will claim to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception: that is not possible.’",
    "ai-mn90:5.4_0": "Those who say that",
    "ai-mn90:5.4_1": "‘The ascetic Gotama will claim to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception: that is not possible.’",
    "ai-mn90:5.4_2": "do they say what you have said without falsely misrepresenting you? Do they explain according to the Teaching so that they can’t be legitimately criticized?",

    "ai-mn90:5.5_2": "They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”",
    "ai-mn90:6.1_0": "Then King Pasenadi addressed General Viḍūḍabha,",
    "ai-mn90:6.2_0": "“General, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”",
    "ai-mn90:6.3_0": "“Great king, Sañjaya, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan, has gone.”",
    "ai-mn90:7.1_0": "Then he addressed a man,",

    "ai-mn90:7.3_0": "King Pasenadi summons him.”",
    "ai-mn90:7.4_0": "“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied.",
    "ai-mn90:7.4_1": "He went to the brahmin Sañjaya and asked him,",
    "ai-mn90:7.5_0": "“Sirs, King Pasenadi summons him.”",
    "ai-mn90:8.1_0": "So the king said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn90:8.2_0": "“Sir, might the Buddha have spoken in reference to one thing, but that person believed it was something else?",
    "ai-mn90:8.3_0": "How then do you recall making this statement?”",
    "ai-mn90:8.4_0": "“Great king, I recall making this statement:",

    "ai-mn90:9.3_0": "Is there any difference between them?”",
    "ai-mn90:9.4_0": "“Great king, there are these four classes:",
    "ai-mn90:9.5_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-mn90:9.6_0": "“Of the four classes, two are said to be preeminent—",
    "ai-mn90:9.7_0": "the aristocrats and the brahmins.",
    "ai-mn90:9.8_0": "That is, when it comes to bowing down, rising up, greeting with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette.”",
    "ai-mn90:10.1_0": "“Sir, I am not asking you about the present life,",
    "ai-mn90:10.2_0": "but about the life to come.”",
    "ai-mn90:10.3_0": "There are these four classes:",
    "ai-mn90:10.4_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-mn90:10.5_0": "Is there any difference between them?”",
    "ai-mn90:10.6_0": "“Great king, there are these five factors that support meditation.",
    "ai-mn90:10.7_0": "What are the five?",
    "ai-mn90:10.8_0": "It’s when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:",
    "ai-mn90:10.9_0": "‘He is indeed a Master, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Master, the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn90:10.10_0": "They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.",
    "ai-mn90:10.11_0": "They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.",
    "ai-mn90:10.12_0": "They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.",
    "ai-mn90:10.13_0": "They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.",
    "ai-mn90:10.14_0": "These are the five factors that support meditation.",
    "ai-mn90:10.15_0": "There are these four classes:",
    "ai-mn90:10.16_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-mn90:10.17_0": "If they had these five factors that support meditation,",
    "ai-mn90:10.18_0": "that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”",
    "ai-mn90:11.1_0": "“Sir, there are these four classes:",
    "ai-mn90:11.2_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-mn90:11.3_0": "If they had these five factors that support meditation,",
    "ai-mn90:11.4_0": "How would there be any distinction or difference between them?”",
    "ai-mn90:11.5_0": "“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their efforts in meditation.",
    "ai-mn90:11.6_0": "Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horses or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.",
    "ai-mn90:11.7_0": "What do you think, great king?",
    "ai-mn90:11.8_0": "Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed, and reach the level of the tamed?”",
    "ai-mn90:11.9_0": "“Yes, sir,” they replied.",
    "ai-mn90:11.10_0": "“But are the pairs of elephants or horses, and oxen in training who were not tamed and trained, and reach the level of the tamed?”",
    "ai-mn90:11.11_0": "“No, sir.” ...",
    "ai-mn90:11.12_0": "“In the same way, there are things that must be attained by someone with faith, health, integrity, energy, and wisdom. It’s not possible for a faithless, unhealthy, deceitful, lazy, witless person to attain them.”",
    "ai-mn90:12.1_0": "“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.",
    "ai-mn90:12.2_0": "There are these four classes:",
    "ai-mn90:12.3_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-mn90:12.4_0": "If they had these five factors that support meditation, and if they practiced rightly,",
    "ai-mn90:12.5_0": "How would there be any distinction or difference between them?”",
    "ai-mn90:12.6_0": "“In that case, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.",
    "ai-mn90:12.7_0": "Suppose a person took dry teak wood and lit a fire and produced heat.",
    "ai-mn90:12.8_0": "Then another person did the same using sāl wood,",
    "ai-mn90:12.9_0": "another used mango wood,",
    "ai-mn90:12.10_0": "while another used wood of the cluster fig.",
    "ai-mn90:12.11_0": "What do you think, great king?",
    "ai-mn90:12.12_0": "Would there be any difference between the fires produced by these different kinds of wood, that is, in the flame, color, or light?”",
    "ai-mn90:12.13_0": "“No, sir.” ...",
    "ai-mn90:12.14_0": "“In the same way, when fire has been kindled by energy and produced by effort, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.”",
    "ai-mn90:13.1_0": "“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.",
    "ai-mn90:13.2_0": "But sir, do gods absolutely exist?”",
    "ai-mn90:13.3_0": "“But great king, why do you say that",
    "ai-mn90:13.4_0": "‘But sir, do gods absolutely exist’?”",
    "ai-mn90:13.5_0": "“What do you think, Sir, is a returner, who comes back to this state of existence or in this state of existence?”",
    "ai-mn90:13.6_0": "“Those gods who are subject to affliction come back to this state of existence, but those free of affliction do not come back.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.1_0": "When he said this, General Viḍūḍabha said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn90:14.2_0": "“Sir, will the gods subject to affliction topple or expel from their place the gods who are free of affliction?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.3_0": "Then Ānanda thought,",
    "ai-mn90:14.4_0": "“This General Viḍūḍabha is King Pasenadi’s son,",
    "ai-mn90:14.5_0": "and I am the Buddha’s son.",
    "ai-mn90:14.6_0": "Now is the time for one son to confer with another.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.7_0": "So Ānanda addressed General Viḍūḍabha,",
    "ai-mn90:14.8_0": "“Well then, general, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.",
    "ai-mn90:14.9_0": "What do you think, general?",
    "ai-mn90:14.10_0": "As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi of Kosala extends, where he rules as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.11_0": "“He can, mister.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.12_0": "“What do you think, general?",
    "ai-mn90:14.13_0": "As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi does not extend, where he does not rule as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.14_0": "“He cannot, mister.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.15_0": "“What do you think, general?",
    "ai-mn90:14.16_0": "Have you heard of them?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.17_0": "“Yes, sir.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.18_0": "I’ve heard of them,",
    "ai-mn90:14.19_0": "and so has the good King Pasenadi.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.20_0": "“What do you think, general?",
    "ai-mn90:14.21_0": "King Pasenadi of Kosala can move him from that, or he’s able to give him the going forth?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.22_0": "“But Master Gotama, who wouldn’t fall apart from that gods of the Thirty-Three or banish him from any of his foes?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.23_0": "“In the same way, general, the gods subject to affliction can’t even see the gods who are free of affliction, so they don’t come to this state of existence,",
    "ai-mn90:14.23_1": "But how could they possibly give him the going forth?”",
    "ai-mn90:15.1_0": "So the king said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn90:15.2_0": "“Sir, what is this mendicant’s name?”",
    "ai-mn90:15.3_0": "“Ānanda, great king.”",
    "ai-mn90:15.4_0": "“A joy he is, and a joy he seems!",
    "ai-mn90:15.5_0": "What Venerable Ānanda says seems reasonable.",
    "ai-mn90:15.6_0": "But sir, does Brahmā absolutely exist?”",
    "ai-mn90:15.7_0": "“But great king, why do you say that",
    "ai-mn90:15.8_0": "‘But sir, does Brahmā absolutely exist?’”",
    "ai-mn90:15.9_0": "“Whether that Brahmā comes back to this state of existence or not.”",
    "ai-mn90:15.10_0": "“Any Brahmā who is subject to affliction comes back to this state of existence, but those free of affliction do not come back.”",
    "ai-mn90:16.1_0": "Then a man said to the king,",
    "ai-mn90:16.2_0": "“Great king, Sañjaya, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan, has come.”",
    "ai-mn90:16.3_0": "Then King Pasenadi asked Sañjaya,",
    "ai-mn90:16.4_0": "“Brahmin, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”",
    "ai-mn90:16.5_0": "“It was General Viḍūḍabha, great king.”",
    "ai-mn90:16.6_0": "But Viḍūḍabha said,",
    "ai-mn90:16.7_0": "“Great king, Sañjaya, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan, has gone.”",
    "ai-mn90:17.1_0": "Then a man said to the king,",
    "ai-mn90:17.2_0": "“It’s time to depart, great king.”",
    "ai-mn90:17.3_0": "So the king said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn90:17.4_0": "“Sir, I asked you about omniscience, and you answered.",
    "ai-mn90:17.5_0": "We like and accept this, and we are satisfied with it.",
    "ai-mn90:17.6_0": "I asked you about the four classes,",

    "ai-mn90:17.13_0": "We like and accept this, and we are satisfied with it.",
    "ai-mn90:17.14_0": "Well, now, sir, I must go.",
    "ai-mn90:17.15_0": "Yet we’re very busy.”",
    "ai-mn90:17.16_0": "“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”",
    "ai-mn90:18.1_0": "Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
    "ai-mn90:18.2_0": "The tenth section on the earrings is finished.",
