    "mn129:40.9_0": "Then that householder-treasure, immersing both hands in the water, pulled up a pot full of gold coin and bullion, and said to the king,",
    "mn129:41.1_0": "Next, the counselor-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.",
    "mn129:41.2_0": "He is astute, competent, intelligent, and capable of getting the king to appoint who should be appointed, dismiss who should be dismissed, and retain who should be retained.",
    "mn129:41.3_0": "He went up to a wheel-turning monarch and said,",
    "mn129:41.4_0": "‘Relax, sire. I shall issue instructions.’",
    "mn129:41.5_0": "Such is the counselor-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.",

    "mn129:43.2_0": "This is the second blessing.",
    "mn129:44.1_0": "Furthermore, he is rarely ill or unwell, and his stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, more so than other people.",
    "mn129:44.2_0": "This is the third blessing.",
    "mn129:45.10_0": "And the king addressed his charioteer,",

    "mn129:45.6_0": "In the same way, the brahmins and householders are as dear to the wheel-turning monarch",
    "mn129:45.7_0": "Once it so happened that a wheel-turning monarch went with his army of four divisions to visit a park.",
    "mn129:45.8_0": "Then the brahmins and householders went up to him and said,",

    "mn129:46.2_0": "Would a wheel-turning monarch who possessed these seven treasures and these four blessings experience pleasure and happiness because of them?”",
    "mn129:46.3_0": "“Sir, a wheel-turning monarch who possessed even a single one of these treasures would experience pleasure and happiness because of that, let alone all seven treasures and four blessings!”",
    "mn129:47.1_0": "Then the Buddha, picking up a lump of living creature, addressed the mendicants:",
    "mn129:47.2_0": "“What do you think, mendicants?",
    "mn129:47.3_0": "Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?”",
    "mn129:47.4_0": "“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny.",
    "mn129:47.4_1": "Compared to the Himalayas, the king of mountains, is not worth a fraction,",

    "mn129:47.4_3": "nor does the world make me harm.”",
    "mn129:47.5_0": "“In the same way, compared to the happiness of heaven, the pleasure and happiness experienced by a wheel-turning monarch due to those seven treasures and those four blessings doesn’t even count, it’s not even a fraction, there’s no comparison.",

    "mn129:48.3_0": "And they’d be attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They’d get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and a bed, house, and lighting.",

    "mn129:48.5_0": "When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.",
    "mn129:49.1_0": "Suppose a gambler on the first lucky throw was to win a big pile of money.",
    "mn129:49.2_0": "But such an unlucky throw was trivial compared to the first lucky throw.",

    "mn129:49.4_0": "This is the total fulfillment of the astute person’s level.”",
    "mn129:49.5_0": "This is what the Buddha said.",
    "mn129:49.6_0": "Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.",
    "mn129:49.7_0": "The ninth section on the ignorant and incompetent is finished.",
    "mn129:5.1_0": "Furthermore, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.",
    "mn129:5.2_0": "It’s like when the mountain peak pulled over a large mountain peak, full to the ground at the crack of dawn.",
    "mn129:5.3_0": "In the same way, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.",
    "mn129:5.4_0": "But then the fool thinks:",

    "mn129:8.1_0": "“I can,” said the Buddha.",
    "mn129:8.20_0": "Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears?”",
    "mn129:8.21_0": "“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!”",
    "mn129:8.2_0": "“Suppose they arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying,",
    "mn129:8.3_0": "‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’",
