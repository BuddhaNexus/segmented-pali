    "mn58:0.2_0": "With Prince Abhaya",
    "mn58:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "mn58:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.",
    "mn58:10.10_0": "All the parts are well-known to me.",
    "mn58:10.11_0": "The answer just appears to me on the spot.”",
    "mn58:10.1_0": "“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.",
    "mn58:10.2_0": "What do you think, prince?",
    "mn58:10.3_0": "Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?”",
    "mn58:10.4_0": "“I am, sir.”",
    "mn58:10.5_0": "“What do you think, prince?",
    "mn58:10.6_0": "When they come to you and ask:",
    "mn58:10.7_0": "‘What’s the name of this chariot part?’",
    "mn58:10.8_0": "Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer appear to you on the spot?”",
    "mn58:10.9_0": "“Sir, I’m well-known as a charioteer skilled in a chariot’s parts.",
    "mn58:11.1_0": "“In the same way, when clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned, the answer just appears to me on the spot.",
    "mn58:11.2_0": "Why is that?",
    "mn58:11.3_0": "Because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that the answer just appears to him on the spot.”",
    "mn58:12.1_0": "When he had spoken, Prince Abhaya said to the Buddha,",
    "mn58:12.2_0": "“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! ...",
    "mn58:12.3_0": "“From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”",
    "mn58:12.4_0": "The eighth chapter on kings, is finished.",

    "mn58:2.1_1": "Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta bowed down, sat down,",
    "mn58:2.1_2": "Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him,",
    "mn58:3.10_0": "For even an ordinary person might utter speech that is disliked by others.’",

    "mn58:3.15_0": "Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’",
    "mn58:3.16_0": "When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.",
    "mn58:3.17_0": "He’ll be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat, unable to either spit it out or swallow it down.”",
    "mn58:3.18_0": "When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.”",
    "mn58:3.1_0": "“Come, prince, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.",
    "mn58:3.2_0": "They’ve got a good reputation:",

    "mn58:3.4_0": "“But sir, how am I to do this?”",
    "mn58:3.5_0": "“Here, prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him:",
    "mn58:3.6_0": "‘Sir, might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?’",
    "mn58:3.7_0": "When he’s asked this, if he answers:",

    "mn58:3.9_0": "‘Then, sir, what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary person?",
    "mn58:4.1_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied Abhaya. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, keeping him on his right.",
    "mn58:4.1_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "mn58:4.2_0": "Then he looked up at the sun and thought,",
    "mn58:4.3_0": "“It’s too late to refute the Buddha’s doctrine today.",
    "mn58:4.4_0": "I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow.” He said to the Buddha,",
    "mn58:4.5_0": "“Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the fourth meal.”",
    "mn58:4.6_0": "And the Buddha consented by remaining silent.",
    "mn58:5.1_0": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
    "mn58:5.2_0": "Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Abhaya’s home, and.",
    "mn58:5.2_1": "where he sat down on a prepared seat.",
    "mn58:5.3_0": "Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.",
    "mn58:5.4_0": "When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Abhaya took a low seat, sat to one side,",
    "mn58:6.10_0": "Prince Abhaya’s powerful and mighty.’",
    "mn58:6.11_0": "When he said this, I said to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta,",

    "mn58:6.19_0": "But if he answers,",
    "mn58:6.1_0": "and said to him,",
    "mn58:6.20_0": "“Perhaps the Realized One doesn’t utter speech that is disliked by others.”",
    "mn58:6.21_0": "So what exactly did you declare of Devadatta:",
    "mn58:6.22_0": "“Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable”?",
    "mn58:6.23_0": "Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’",

    "mn58:6.3_0": "“This is no simple matter, prince.”",
    "mn58:6.4_0": "“Then the Jains have lost in this, sir.”",
    "mn58:6.5_0": "“But prince, why do you say that",
    "mn58:6.6_0": "the Jains have lost in this?”",
    "mn58:6.7_0": "Then Abhaya, sir, I approached Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta.",
    "mn58:6.7_1": "Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta bowed, and sat down to one side.",

    "mn58:7.3_0": "“What do you think, prince?",
    "mn58:7.4_0": "If—because of your negligence or his nurse’s negligence—your boy was to put a stick or stone in his mouth, what would you do to him?”",
    "mn58:7.5_0": "“I’d try to take it out, sir.",
    "mn58:7.6_0": "If that didn’t work, I’d hold his head with my left hand, and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand, even if it drew blood.",
    "mn58:7.7_0": "Why is that?",
    "mn58:7.8_0": "Because I have compassion for the boy, sir.”",
