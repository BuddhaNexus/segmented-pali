    "ai-mn81:10.6_0": "Then they got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa, keeping him on their right, before leaving.",
    "ai-mn81:11.1_0": "Then Jotipāla said to Ghatīkāra,",
    "ai-mn81:11.2_0": "‘Dear Ghaṭīkāra, you have heard this teaching, so why don’t you go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’",
    "ai-mn81:11.3_0": "‘Don’t you know, dear Jotipāla, that I look after my blind old parents?’",
    "ai-mn81:11.4_0": "‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’",

    "ai-mn81:13.2_0": "Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Benares,",

    "ai-mn81:14.1_1": "that he had arrived.",
    "ai-mn81:14.2_0": "He had the finest carriages harnessed. He then mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Benares to see the Buddha Kassapa.",
    "ai-mn81:14.3_0": "He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha Kassapa on foot.",
    "ai-mn81:14.3_1": "He went to the Buddha Kassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side.",
    "ai-mn81:14.4_0": "The Buddha Kassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.",
    "ai-mn81:14.5_0": "Then King Kikī said to the Buddha,",

    "ai-mn81:14.7_0": "The Buddha Kassapa consented in silence.",
    "ai-mn81:15.1_0": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, King Kikī got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
    "ai-mn81:16.1_0": "And when the night had passed, King Kikī had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home—soft saffron rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,",
    "ai-mn81:16.2_0": "‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’",
    "ai-mn81:17.1_0": "Then Kassapa Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of King Kikī, where he approached the brahmin Sikhī’s home.",
    "ai-mn81:17.1_1": "where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.",
    "ai-mn81:17.2_0": "Then King Kikī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.",
    "ai-mn81:17.3_0": "When the Buddha Kassapa had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, King Kikī took a low seat and sat to one side.",
    "ai-mn81:17.4_0": "There he said to the Buddha Kassapa,",
    "ai-mn81:17.5_0": "‘Venerable Sir, please accept my rainy-season residence at Benares.",
    "ai-mn81:17.6_0": "such a thing.’",
    "ai-mn81:17.7_0": "‘Enough, Great King.",

    "ai-mn81:17.9_0": "For a second time ...",
    "ai-mn81:17.10_0": "and a third time King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa,",

    "ai-mn81:17.12_0": "such a thing.’",

    "ai-mn81:17.14_0": "I’ve completed the rainy season residence.’",
    "ai-mn81:17.15_0": "Then King Kikī, thinking, ‘The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Benares,’ became sad and upset.",
    "ai-mn81:17.16_0": "Then King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa,",
    "ai-mn81:17.17_0": "‘Sir, do you have another supporter better than me?’",
    "ai-mn81:18.1_0": "‘Great king, there is a market town named Vebhaliṅga,",
    "ai-mn81:18.2_0": "where there’s a potter named Ghaṭīkāra.",
    "ai-mn81:18.3_0": "He is my chief supporter.",
    "ai-mn81:18.4_0": "Now, great king, you thought, “The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Benares,” and you became sad and upset.",
    "ai-mn81:18.5_0": "But Ghaṭīkāra doesn’t get upset, nor will he.",
    "ai-mn81:18.6_0": "Ghaṭīkāra has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.",
    "ai-mn81:18.7_0": "He doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.",
    "ai-mn81:18.8_0": "He has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones.",
    "ai-mn81:18.9_0": "He is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.",
    "ai-mn81:18.10_0": "He eats in one part of the day; he’s celibate, ethical, and of good character.",
    "ai-mn81:18.11_0": "He’s gold coined with gold, silver, and money.",
    "ai-mn81:18.12_0": "He’s put down the shovel and doesn’t dig the earth with his own hands.",
    "ai-mn81:18.13_0": "He takes what has crumbled off by a riverbank or been dug up by mice, and brings it back in a carrier. When he has made a pot, he says,",
    "ai-mn81:18.14_0": "“Anyone may leave bagged sesame, mung beans, or chickpeas here and take what they wish.”",
    "ai-mn81:18.15_0": "He looks after his blind old parents.",
    "ai-mn81:18.16_0": "And since he has ended the five lower fetters, Ghaṭīkāra will be reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.",
    "ai-mn81:19.1_0": "This one time, great king, I was staying near the market town of Vebhaliṅga.",
    "ai-mn81:19.2_0": "Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to Ghaṭīkāra’s parents and said,",
    "ai-mn81:19.2_1": "He went to his parents and said,",
    "ai-mn81:19.3_0": "“So, Bharadvāja, has this peak?”",
    "ai-mn81:19.4_0": "“Your supporter has gone out, sir. But take rice from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.”",
    "ai-mn81:19.5_0": "So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.",
    "ai-mn81:19.6_0": "Then Ghaṭīkāra went to his parents.",
    "ai-mn81:19.6_1": "and said to her parents:",
    "ai-mn81:19.7_0": "“Who took rice from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”",
    "ai-mn81:19.8_0": "“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”",
    "ai-mn81:19.9_0": "Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,",
    "ai-mn81:19.10_0": "“I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,",
    "ai-mn81:19.11_0": "in that the Buddha Kassapa trusts me so much!”",
    "ai-mn81:19.12_0": "Then Ghaṭīkāra doesn’t give birth to rapture and bliss.",
    "ai-mn81:20.1_0": "This one time, great king, I was staying right there near the market town of Vebhaliṅga.",
    "ai-mn81:20.2_0": "Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to Ghaṭīkāra’s parents and said,",
    "ai-mn81:20.2_1": "He went to his parents and said,",

    "ai-mn81:20.6_0": "Then Ghaṭīkāra went to his parents.",
    "ai-mn81:20.6_1": "and said to her parents:",
    "ai-mn81:20.7_0": "“Who would grabbed a rolling-pin and left?”",
    "ai-mn81:20.8_0": "“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”",
    "ai-mn81:20.9_0": "Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,",

    "ai-mn81:21.2_0": "Now at that time my hut leaked.",
    "ai-mn81:21.3_0": "So I addressed the mendicants,",
    "ai-mn81:21.4_0": "“Mendicants, go to Ghaṭikāra’s home and find some grass.”",
    "ai-mn81:21.5_0": "When I said this, those mendicants said to me,",
    "ai-mn81:21.6_0": "“Sir, there’s no grass there, but his workshop has a grass roof.”",
    "ai-mn81:21.7_0": "“Then go to the workshop and strip the grass.”",
    "ai-mn81:21.8_0": "So that’s what they did.",
    "ai-mn81:21.9_0": "Then Ghaṭīkāra’s parents said to those mendicants,",
    "ai-mn81:21.10_0": "“Who’s stripping the grass from the workshop?”",
    "ai-mn81:21.11_0": "“It’s the mendicants, sister. The Buddha’s hut is leaking.”",
    "ai-mn81:21.12_0": "“Take it, sirs! Take it, my dears!”",
    "ai-mn81:21.13_0": "Then Ghaṭīkāra went to his parents.",
    "ai-mn81:21.13_1": "and said to her parents:",
    "ai-mn81:21.14_0": "“Who stripped the grass from the workshop?”",
    "ai-mn81:21.15_0": "“It was the mendicants, dear. It seems the Buddha’s hut is leaking.”",

    "ai-mn81:21.20_0": "Then the workshop remained with the sky for a roof for the whole three months, but no rain fell on it.",

    "ai-mn81:21.22_0": "‘Ghaṭīkāra the potter is fortunate, very fortunate,",
