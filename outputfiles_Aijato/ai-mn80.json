    "mn80:10.2_0": "Which of these two has a finer splendor: the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath, or the sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season?”",
    "mn80:10.3_0": "“The sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season.”",
    "mn80:11.1_0": "“Beyond this, Kaccāna, very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon make no impression.",

    "mn80:12.2_0": "What are the teachings grouped by five?",
    "mn80:12.3_0": "Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.",

    "mn80:13.1_0": "The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.",
    "mn80:13.2_0": "So there is the saying: ‘From the senses comes sensual pleasure. From sensual pleasure comes the best kind of sensual pleasure, which is said to be the best thing there.’”",
    "mn80:14.1_0": "When he said this, the wanderer Vekhanasa said to the Buddha,",

    "mn80:15.1_0": "When he said this, Vekhanasa became angry and upset. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying,",

    "mn80:15.5_0": "Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, void and hollow.”",
    "mn80:16.10_0": "They’d know ‘I’m released,’ and there would be no more bonds.",
    "mn80:16.11_0": "In the same way, let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them.",

    "mn80:16.3_0": "There is a legitimate refutation of them.",
