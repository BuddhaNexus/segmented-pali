    "ai-dn3:1.2.2_0": "Pokkharasāti heard:",
    "ai-dn3:1.2.3_0": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby.",

He was one who recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philogy and gramar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.

    "ai-dn3:1.5.2_0": "“Dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.",

    "ai-dn3:1.5.10_0": "and receive them.”",
    "ai-dn3:1.6.1_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied Ambaṭṭha. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti, keeping him to his right. He mounted a mare-drawn chariot and, together with several students, set out for the forest near Icchānaṅgala.",
    "ai-dn3:1.6.2_0": "He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.",
    "ai-dn3:1.7.1_0": "At that time a number of monks were walking mindfully in the open air.",
    "ai-dn3:1.7.2_0": "Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and said,",

    "ai-dn3:1.9.3_0": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Ambaṭṭha sat down to one side, and the Buddha then sat down to one side.",
    "ai-dn3:1.9.4_0": "So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha,",
    "ai-dn3:1.9.5_0": "“Ambaṭṭha, is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers: walking around or standing while I’m sitting, speaking some polite words or other?”",
    "ai-dn3:1.10.0_0": "2.1. The First Use of the Word “Riffraff” ",
    "ai-dn3:1.10.1_0": "“No, Master Gotama.",
    "ai-dn3:1.10.2_0": "For it is proper for one brahmin to converse with another while both are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down.",
    "ai-dn3:1.10.3_0": "But as to these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, I converse with them as I do with Master Gotama.”",
    "ai-dn3:1.11.1_0": "“Well, Ambaṭṭha, there was a place where I went to the place for alms. And when you attend such a person, you might focus on the meaning of this the teaching.",
    "ai-dn3:1.11.2_0": "Though this Ambaṭṭha is unqualified, he thinks he’s qualified. What is that but lack of qualifications?”",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.1_0": "When he said this, Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of being described as unqualified. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying,",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.2_0": "“The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.3_0": "“Master Gotama, the Sakyan clan are rude,",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.4_0": "they were born and harsh.",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.5_0": "He was lord of the Sakyans.",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.6_0": "and argumentative.",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.7_0": "Riffraff they are, and riffraff they remain! They don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.8_0": "This is not proper for one’s.",
    "ai-dn3:1.12.9_0": "And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the first time.",
    "ai-dn3:1.13.0_0": "2.2. The Second Use of the Word “Riffraff” ",
    "ai-dn3:1.13.1_0": "“But, Ambaṭṭha, what is your own son?”",
    "ai-dn3:1.13.2_0": "“This one time, Master Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the brahmin Pokkharasāti.",
    "ai-dn3:1.13.3_0": "I approached the Sakyans in their meeting hall.",
    "ai-dn3:1.13.4_0": "Now at that time several Sakyans and Sakyan princes were sitting on high seats, poking each other with their fingers, giggling and playing together. In fact, they even presumed to giggle at me, and didn’t invite me to a seat.",
    "ai-dn3:1.13.5_0": "This is not proper for one’s.",
    "ai-dn3:1.13.6_0": "And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the second time.",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.0_0": "2.3. The Third Use of the Word “Riffraff” ",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.1_0": "“Even a little quail, Ambaṭṭha, speaks as she likes in her own nest.",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.2_0": "But the Sakyans of Ambaṭṭha is too far from the Sakyans. It’s not appropriate for you to little.”",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.3_0": "“Master Gotama, there are these four castes:",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.4_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.5_0": "Three of these castes—",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.6_0": "aristocrats, merchants, and workers—",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.7_0": "in fact succeed only in serving the brahmins.",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.8_0": "This is not proper for one’s.",
    "ai-dn3:1.14.9_0": "And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the third time.",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.0_0": "2.4. The Word “Son of Bondservants” is Used ",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.1_0": "Then it occurred to the Buddha:",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.2_0": "“This Ambaṭṭha puts the Sakyans down too much by calling them riffraff. Why don’t I ask him about his own clan?”",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.3_0": "So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha,",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.4_0": "“What is your clan, Ambaṭṭha?”",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.5_0": "“I am a Kaṇhāyana, Master Gotama.”",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.6_0": "“But, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a female bondservant of the Sakyans.",

    "ai-dn3:1.15.7_0": "But the Sakyans claim King Okkāka as their grandfather.",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.8_0": "Once upon a time, King Okkāka, wishing to divert the royal succession to the son of his most beloved queen, banished the elder princes from the realm—",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.9_0": "Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika, and Sinisūra.",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.10_0": "They made their home beside a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, where there was a large teak grove.",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.11_0": "For fear of diluting their lineage, they slept with their own sisters.",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.12_0": "Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and counselors,",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.13_0": "‘Where, sirs, have the princes settled now?’",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.14_0": "‘Sire, there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, by a large grove of _sāka_, the teak tree. They’ve settled there.",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.15_0": "For fear of diluting their lineage, they are sleeping with their own (_saka_) sisters.’",
    "ai-dn3:1.15.16_0": "Then, Ambaṭṭha, King Okkāka expressed this heartfelt sentiment:",

    "ai-dn3:1.18.1_0": "So the Buddha said to the students,",

    "ai-dn3:1.20.1_0": "So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha,",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.2_0": "“Well, Ambaṭṭha, there’s a legitimate question that comes up. You won’t like it, but you ought to answer anyway.",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.3_0": "If you don’t answer, but dodge the issue, remain silent, or simply leave, your head will explode into seven pieces right here.",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.4_0": "What do you think, Ambaṭṭha?",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.5_0": "Have you heard that the brahmins who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, say, Kaṇhāyaka, or a superior man in the past?”",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.6_0": "When he said this, Ambaṭṭha kept silent.",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.7_0": "For a second time, the Buddha put the question,",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.8_0": "“What have you heard that the brahmins who are elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life?”",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.9_0": "and for a second time Ambaṭṭha kept silent.",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.10_0": "So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha,",
    "ai-dn3:1.20.11_0": "“Answer now, Ambaṭṭha. Now is not the time for silence.",
