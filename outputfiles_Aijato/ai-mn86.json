    "mn86:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
    "mn86:10.1_0": "“I have no anger in Vesālī, Sir, the King of Magadha angry with the Licchavīs, nor does he take others to do so.",
    "mn86:10.2_0": "In my realm there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. ...",
    "mn86:10.3_0": "He laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.",
    "mn86:10.4_0": "He was constantly murdering people, and he wore their fingers as a necklace.",
    "mn86:10.5_0": "I shall put a stop to him.”",
    "mn86:11.1_0": "“But great king, suppose you were to see that Aṅgulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. And that he was refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and lying; that he was eating in one part of the day, and was celibate, ethical, and of good character. What would you do to him?”",
    "mn86:11.2_0": "“I would bow to him, rise in his presence, or offer him a seat. I’d invite him to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize his lawful guarding and protection.",
    "mn86:11.3_0": "But sir, how could such an immoral, evil man ever have such virtue and restraint?”",
    "mn86:12.10_0": "“Yes, great king.”",
    "mn86:12.11_0": "“Who is your father?”",

    "mn86:12.1_0": "Now at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla was sitting not far from the Buddha.",
    "mn86:12.2_0": "Then the Buddha pointed with his right arm and said to the king,",
    "mn86:12.3_0": "“Great king, this is Aṅgulimāla.”",

    "mn86:12.6_0": "“Do not fear, great king. You have nothing to fear from him.”",
    "mn86:12.7_0": "Then the king’s fear died down.",

    "mn86:13.10_0": "“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”",
    "mn86:13.11_0": "Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
    "mn86:13.1_0": "But at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, and owned just three robes.",
    "mn86:13.2_0": "So he said to the king,",
    "mn86:13.3_0": "“Enough, great king. My robes are complete.”",
    "mn86:13.4_0": "Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha,",
    "mn86:13.4_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "mn86:13.4_2": "King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the Buddha, and said,",
    "mn86:13.5_0": "He said, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!",
    "mn86:13.6_0": "How the Buddha tames those who are wild, pacifies those who are violent, and extinguishes those who are unextinguished!",
    "mn86:13.7_0": "For I was not able to tame him with the rod and the sword, but the Buddha tamed him without rod or sword.",
    "mn86:13.8_0": "Well, now, sir, I must go.",
    "mn86:13.9_0": "Yet we’re very busy.”",

    "mn86:14.3_0": "He thought,",
    "mn86:14.4_0": "“Oh, beings suffer such filth!",
    "mn86:14.5_0": "Oh, beings suffer such filth!”",
    "mn86:14.6_0": "Then after wandering for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha.",
    "mn86:14.6_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "mn86:14.6_2": "The Buddha said to him,",
    "mn86:14.7_0": "“Sir, once I’ve robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.",
    "mn86:14.8_0": "So while wandering indiscriminately for alms-food I saw a woman undergoing a painful obstructed labor.",
    "mn86:14.9_0": "Seeing him, I thought:",
    "mn86:15.1_0": "“Well then, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:",
    "mn86:15.2_0": "‘Ever since I was born, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”",
    "mn86:15.3_0": "“But sir, wouldn’t that be telling a deliberate lie?",
    "mn86:15.4_0": "For I have intentionally killed many living creatures.”",
    "mn86:15.5_0": "“Well then, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:",
    "mn86:15.6_0": "‘Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”",
    "mn86:15.7_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied Aṅgulimāla. He went to that woman",
    "mn86:15.7_1": "She went to her and said,",

    "mn86:15.9_0": "Then that woman was safe, and so was her baby.",
    "mn86:16.1_0": "Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.",
    "mn86:16.2_0": "He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”",
    "mn86:16.3_0": "And Venerable Aṅgulimāla became one of the perfected.",
    "mn86:17.1_0": "Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.",
    "mn86:17.2_0": "Now at that time someone threw a stone that hit Aṅgulimāla, someone else threw a stick, and someone else threw gravel.",
    "mn86:17.3_0": "Then Aṅgulimāla—with cracked head, bleeding, his bowl broken, and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha.",
    "mn86:17.4_0": "The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance,",
