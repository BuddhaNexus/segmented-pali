    "ai-iti99:0.3_0": "Chapter Five",
    "ai-iti99:0.4_0": "99. The Three Knowledges",
    "ai-iti99:1.1_0": "For this was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.",
    "ai-iti99:2.1_0": "“Mendicants, I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation.",
    "ai-iti99:3.1_0": "And how do I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation?",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_0": "It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is:",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_1": "‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_2": "They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_3": "This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_4": "This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_5": "There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.",
    "ai-iti99:3.3_0": "This was the first knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.",
    "ai-iti99:4.1_0": "Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds:",
    "ai-iti99:4.1_1": "‘These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who abused the noble ones, who had wrong views and acted accordingly,",
    "ai-iti99:4.1_2": "They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.",
    "ai-iti99:4.1_3": "‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.",
    "ai-iti99:4.1_4": "They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view.",
    "ai-iti99:4.1_5": "They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.",
    "ai-iti99:4.2_0": "This was the second knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.",
    "ai-iti99:5.1_0": "Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.",
    "ai-iti99:5.2_0": "This was the third knowledge which they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.",
    "ai-iti99:5.3_0": "That’s how I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation.”",
    "ai-iti99:5.4_0": "And the Buddha said this:",
    "ai-iti99:5.5_0": "And so there’s called",
    "ai-iti99:6.1_0": "“They know their past lives,",
    "ai-iti99:6.2_0": "and see heaven and places of loss,",
    "ai-iti99:6.3_0": "and have attained the end of rebirth:",
    "ai-iti99:6.4_0": "that sage has perfect insight.",
    "ai-iti99:7.1_0": "Three knowledges",
    "ai-iti99:7.2_0": "that a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.",
    "ai-iti99:7.3_0": "That’s what I call a master of the three knowledges,",
    "ai-iti99:7.4_0": "and not some mere reciter.”",
    "ai-iti99:8.1_0": "That is what the Buddha has heard.",
