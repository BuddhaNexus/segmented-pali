    "mn71:10.1_0": "‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.”",
    "mn71:11.1_0": "When he said this, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha:",
    "mn71:11.2_0": "“Master Gotama, are there any laypeople who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”",

    "mn71:12.2_0": "“There’s not just one hundred laypeople, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, go to heaven when the body breaks up.”",
    "mn71:13.1_0": "“Master Gotama, are there any Ājīvaka ascetics who make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”",

    "mn71:6.1_0": "“So how should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”",
    "mn71:6.2_0": "“‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.",
    "mn71:7.1_0": "For, Vaccha, whenever I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives.",
    "mn71:7.2_0": "That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember:",
