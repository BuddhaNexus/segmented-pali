These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.",
    "mn4:3.1_0": "Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought,",

    "mn4:31.2_0": "I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ ... ‘This is the origin of suffering’ ... ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ ... ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.'",
    "mn4:31.3_0": "I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ ... ‘This is the origin of defilements’ ... ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ ... ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’",
    "mn4:32.1_0": "Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.",
    "mn4:32.2_0": "When it was freed, I knew it was freed,",
    "mn4:32.3_0": "and I understood that birth had come to an end, the spiritual life had been lived, the job had been done, there was no further state of existence.",
    "mn4:33.1_0": "This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the final watch of the night.",
    "mn4:33.2_0": "Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.",
    "mn4:34.1_0": "Brahmin, you might think:",
    "mn4:34.2_0": "‘Perhaps the Master Gotama is not free of greed, hate, and delusion even today, and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’",
    "mn4:34.3_0": "But you should not see it like this.",
    "mn4:34.4_0": "I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.",
    "mn4:34.5_0": "I see a happy life for myself in the present, and I have compassion for future generations.”",
    "mn4:35.1_0": "“Indeed, Master Gotama has compassion for future generations, since he is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.",
    "mn4:35.2_0": "Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama!",
    "mn4:35.3_0": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.",
    "mn4:35.3_1": "those with eyes might see what’s there—",
    "mn4:35.3_2": "just so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways.",
    "mn4:35.4_0": "Good Gotama, I go for refuge to you, and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks.",
    "mn4:35.5_0": "From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”",
    "mn4:35.6_0": "The fourth section on fear and dread is finished.",
