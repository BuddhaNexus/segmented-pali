    "ai-dn21:1.1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans; east of Rājagaha there’s a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā, north of which, on Mount Vediyaka, is the Indasāla cave.",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.3_0": "Now at that time Sakka, the lord of gods, became eager to see the Buddha.",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.4_0": "Then Sakka, lord of gods, thought,",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.5_0": "“Where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.6_0": "He saw that the Buddha was at the Indasāla cave,",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.7_0": "and addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three,",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.8_0": "“Good sirs, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Indasāla cave.",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.9_0": "What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”",
    "ai-dn21:1.1.10_0": "“Yes, lord,” replied the gods.",
    "ai-dn21:1.2.1_0": "So he addressed Pañcasikha,",
    "ai-dn21:1.2.2_0": "“Dear Pañcasikha, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Indasāla cave.",
    "ai-dn21:1.2.3_0": "What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”",
    "ai-dn21:1.2.4_0": "“Yes, lord,” replied the fairy Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went as Sakka’s attendant.",
    "ai-dn21:1.2.5_0": "Sakka released the gods of the Thirty-Three at the most author of the Thirty-Three.",
    "ai-dn21:1.2.6_0": "Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof, and reappeared in front of those mendicants on the bank of the river Vaggumudā.",
    "ai-dn21:1.2.6_1": "In the same way, in the land of the Magadhans, the brahmin village of Rājagaha there is a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā,",
    "ai-dn21:1.3.1_0": "Now at that time a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā, as happens through the glory of the gods.",

    "ai-dn21:1.4.1_0": "So he addressed Pañcasikha,",
    "ai-dn21:1.4.2_0": "“My dear Pañcasikha, it’s hard for one like me to get near the Realized Ones while they are on retreat practicing absorption, enjoying absorption.",
    "ai-dn21:1.4.3_0": "But if you were to charm the Buddha first, then I could go to see him.”",
    "ai-dn21:1.4.4_0": "“Yes, lord,” replied the fairy Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went to the Indasāla cave. When he had drawn near, he stood to one side, thinking,",

    "ai-dn21:1.8.6_0": "“Yes, lord,” replied Pañcasikha. He bowed to the Buddha and said,",
    "ai-dn21:1.8.7_0": "“Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”",
    "ai-dn21:1.8.8_0": "“So may Sakka with his ministers and retinue be happy, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn21:1.8.9_0": "“for all want to be happy—whether gods, humans, demons, dragons, fairies, or any of the other diverse creatures there may be.”",
    "ai-dn21:1.8.10_0": "For that is how the Realized Ones salute such illustrious spirits.",
    "ai-dn21:1.8.11_0": "And being saluted by the Buddha, Sakka entered the Indasāla cave, bowed to the Buddha, and stood to one side.",
    "ai-dn21:1.8.12_0": "And the gods of the Thirty-Three did likewise,",
    "ai-dn21:1.8.13_0": "as did Pañcasikha.",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.1_0": "And at that time the uneven places were evened out, the cramped places were opened up, the darkness vanished and light appeared, as happens through the glory of the gods.",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.2_0": "Then the Buddha said to Sakka,",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.3_0": "“It’s incredible and amazing that you, the venerable Kosiya, who has so many duties and so much to do, should come here.”",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.4_0": "“For a long time I’ve wanted to come and see the Buddha,",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.4_1": "However, they didn’t do their duty for the Gods of the Thirty-Three,",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.4_2": "I wasn’t able to go to see the Buddha.",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.5_0": "This one time, sir, the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut.",
    "ai-dn21:1.9.6_0": "Then I went to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.1_0": "But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in some kind of meditation. And a divine maiden of Great King Vessavaṇa named Bhūjati was attending on the Buddha, standing there paying homage to him with joined palms.",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.2_0": "So I said to her,",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.3_0": "‘Sister, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying:",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.4_0": "“Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”’",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.5_0": "When I said this, she said to me,",

    "ai-dn21:1.10.9_0": "“Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”’",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.10_0": "I hope that sister bowed to you?",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.11_0": "Do you remember what she said?”",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.12_0": "“She did bow, lord of gods, and I remember what she said.",
    "ai-dn21:1.10.13_0": "I also remember that it was the sound of your chariot wheels that pulled me out of that immersion.”",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.1_0": "“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the gods who were reborn in the host of the Thirty-Three before me:",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.2_0": "‘When a Realized One arises in the world, perfected and fully awakened, the heavenly hosts swell, while the demon hosts dwindle.’",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.3_0": "And this thing happened that I have arisen in the world, a Realized One—a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—for the heavenly host of gods.",

    "ai-dn21:1.11.5_0": "Right here in Kapilavatthu there was a Sakyan lady named Gopikā who had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled her ethics.",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.6_0": "Losing her attachment to femininity, she developed masculinity. When her body broke up, after death, she was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.7_0": "In the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three she became one of my sons.",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.8_0": "There they knew that",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.9_0": "the god Gopaka.",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.10_0": "Meanwhile three others, mendicants who had led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior fairy realm.",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.11_0": "There they amused themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and became my servants and attendants.",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.12_0": "At that, Gopaka scolded them,",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.13_0": "‘Where on earth were you at, good sirs, when you heard the Buddha’s teaching!",
    "ai-dn21:1.11.14_0": "So, when my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three.",

    "ai-dn21:1.11.19_0": "When scolded by Gopaka, two of those gods in that very life gained mindfulness leading to the host of Brahmā’s Ministers. But one god remained attached to sensuality.",
