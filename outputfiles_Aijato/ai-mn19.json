    "mn19:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "mn19:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
    "mn19:1.3_0": "There he addressed the mendicants:",
    "mn19:1.4_0": "“Yes, mendicants.”",
    "mn19:1.5_0": "“The mendicants replied.",
    "mn19:1.6_0": "The Buddha said to him:",
    "mn19:11.1_0": "In sacrifice, a mendicant often occurs to the extent of their mind’s thoughts, and they don’t think:",
    "mn19:11.2_0": "If they often think about and consider thoughts of renunciation, they’ve given up sensual thought to cultivate the thought of renunciation. Their mind inclines to thoughts of renunciation.",
    "mn19:11.3_0": "If they often think about and consider thoughts of good will ... their mind inclines to thoughts of good will.",
    "mn19:11.4_0": "If they often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness ... their mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessness.",
    "mn19:12.1_0": "Suppose it’s the last month of summer, when all the crops have been gathered into the neighborhood of a village, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle. While at the root of a tree or in the open he need only be mindful that",
    "mn19:12.2_0": "the cattle are there.",
    "mn19:12.3_0": "In the same way I needed only to be mindful that",
    "mn19:12.4_0": "those things were there.",
    "mn19:13.1_0": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi.",
    "mn19:14.1_0": "Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.",
    "mn19:15.1_0": "Through the stilling of the movement of the mind, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has internal confidence and unification of mind and consists of joy and bliss born of stillness.",
    "mn19:16.1_0": "And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’",
    "mn19:17.1_0": "Through the abandoning of bliss and suffering and the earlier ending of joy and aversion, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, which has neither suffering nor happiness and consists of purity of mindfulness and even-mindedness.",
    "mn19:18.1_0": "When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.",
    "mn19:18.2_0": "I recollected many kinds of past lives.",
    "mn19:18.2_1": "They are reborn in the company of the gods.",
    "mn19:18.2_2": "When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.",
    "mn19:19.1_0": "This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.",
    "mn19:19.2_0": "Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose;",
    "mn19:19.2_1": "the darkness arose.",
    "mn19:19.2_2": "While meditating diligent, keen, and resolute.",
    "mn19:2.1_0": "“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:",
    "mn19:2.2_0": "‘Why don’t I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classes?’",
    "mn19:2.3_0": "So I assigned sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts",
    "mn19:2.4_0": "to one class.",
    "mn19:2.5_0": "And I assigned thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness",
    "mn19:2.6_0": "to the second class.",
    "mn19:20.1_0": "When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.",
    "mn19:20.2_0": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.",
    "mn19:20.2_1": "‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. ...",
    "mn19:20.2_2": "They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.",
    "mn19:21.1_0": "This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.",
    "mn19:21.2_0": "Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose;",

    "mn19:21.2_2": "While meditating diligent, keen, and resolute.",
    "mn19:22.1_0": "When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this, I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.",
    "mn19:22.2_0": "I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ ... ‘This is the origin of suffering’ ... ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ ... ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.'",
    "mn19:23.1_0": "I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ ... ‘This is the origin of defilements’ ... ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ ... ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’",
    "mn19:23.2_0": "Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.",
    "mn19:23.3_0": "and I understood that birth had come to an end, the spiritual life had been lived, the job had been done, there was no further state of existence.",
    "mn19:24.1_0": "This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.",

    "mn19:25.2_0": "and a large herd of deer lived nearby.",
    "mn19:25.3_0": "Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten them.",
    "mn19:25.4_0": "They close off the safe, secure path that leads to happiness, and open the wrong path. There they plant domesticated male and female deer as decoys",
    "mn19:25.5_0": "so that, in due course, that herd of deer would fall to ruin and disaster.",
    "mn19:25.6_0": "Then along comes a person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe.",
    "mn19:25.7_0": "They open up the safe, secure path that leads to happiness, and close off the wrong path. They get rid of the decoys",
    "mn19:25.8_0": "so that, in due course, that herd of deer would grow, increase, and mature.",
    "mn19:26.10_0": "‘A person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.",

    "mn19:26.12_0": "right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.",
    "mn19:26.13_0": "So, mendicants, I have opened up the safe, secure path to happiness and closed off the wrong path. And I have got rid of the male and female decoys.",
    "mn19:26.1_0": "I’ve made up this simile to make a point.",

    "mn19:27.3_0": "This is what the Buddha said.",

    "mn19:27.5_0": "The ninth section on two thoughts is finished.",
    "mn19:3.1_0": "Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of sensuality arose.",
