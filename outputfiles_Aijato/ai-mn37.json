    "mn37:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "mn37:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.",
    "mn37:10.1_0": "They were just like a daughter-in-law who is prudent and discreet when they see their father-in-law.",
    "mn37:10.2_0": "In the same way, when they see Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s maids, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.",
    "mn37:10.3_0": "Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying,",
    "mn37:10.4_0": "“See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing!",
    "mn37:10.5_0": "And that lovely thing!”",
    "mn37:10.6_0": "“That looks nice for Venerable Kosiya, just like for someone who has made merit in the past.",
    "mn37:10.7_0": "Humans, when they see something lovely, also say:",

    "mn37:10.9_0": "That looks nice for Venerable Kosiya, just like for someone who has made merit in the past.”",
    "mn37:11.1_0": "Then Moggallāna thought,",
    "mn37:11.2_0": "“This spirit lives much too negligently.",
    "mn37:11.3_0": "Why don’t I stir up a sense of urgency in him?”",
    "mn37:11.4_0": "Then Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe.",
    "mn37:11.5_0": "Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the Gods of the Thirty-Three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,",
    "mn37:11.6_0": "“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!",
    "mn37:11.7_0": "The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!”",
    "mn37:12.1_0": "Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Moggallāna said to him,",
    "mn37:12.2_0": "“But how does the Buddha understand freedom through the ending of craving?’",
    "mn37:12.3_0": "It’s good that we can listen to the teachings.”",
    "mn37:12.4_0": "“My dear Moggallāna, I approached the Buddha.",
    "mn37:12.4_1": "and bowed down to the Buddha.",
    "mn37:12.4_2": "Standing to one side, I said to the Buddha:",
    "mn37:12.5_0": "‘Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?’",
    "mn37:13.10_0": "He understands: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”",
    "mn37:13.11_0": "That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.’",
    "mn37:13.12_0": "That’s how the Buddha briefly explained freedom through the ending of craving to me.”",
    "mn37:13.1_0": "When I had spoken the Buddha said to me:",

    "mn37:13.7_0": "They meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.",
    "mn37:13.8_0": "Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.",
    "mn37:13.9_0": "Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.",
    "mn37:14.1_0": "Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Sakka said. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he reappeared in front of Sakka,",
    "mn37:14.1_1": "so too the Buddha disappeared about the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother appeared in front of the Thirty-Three.",
    "mn37:14.2_0": "Soon after Moggallāna left, Sakka’s maids said to him,",
    "mn37:14.3_0": "“Good sir, was that the Blessed One, your Teacher?”",
    "mn37:14.4_0": "“No, it was not.",
    "mn37:14.5_0": "That was my spiritual companion Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.”",
    "mn37:14.6_0": "“You’re fortunate, good sir, so very fortunate,",

    "mn37:15.3_2": "He bowed, stood to one side, and said to me:",
