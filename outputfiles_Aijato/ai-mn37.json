    "ai-mn37:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-mn37:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.",
    "ai-mn37:2.1_0": "Then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn37:2.1_1": "bowed down to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn37:2.1_2": "He went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,",
    "ai-mn37:2.2_0": "“Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”",
    "ai-mn37:3.1_0": "“Lord of Gods, it’s when a mendicant has heard:",
    "ai-mn37:3.2_0": "nothing is worth insisting on.",
    "ai-mn37:3.3_0": "When a mendicant has heard that",
    "ai-mn37:3.4_0": "nothing is worth insisting on.",
    "ai-mn37:3.5_0": "they directly know all things.",
    "ai-mn37:3.5_1": "they directly know all things.",
    "ai-mn37:3.5_2": "Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—",
    "ai-mn37:3.6_0": "they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.",
    "ai-mn37:3.7_0": "Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.",
    "ai-mn37:3.8_0": "Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.",
    "ai-mn37:3.9_0": "He understands: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’",
    "ai-mn37:3.10_0": "That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.”",
    "ai-mn37:4.1_0": "Then Sakka, lord of gods, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.",
    "ai-mn37:5.1_0": "Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was meditating not far from the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn37:5.2_0": "Then Moggallāna thought,",
    "ai-mn37:5.3_0": "“Did that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he agreed with him, or not?",
    "ai-mn37:5.4_0": "Why don’t I find out?”",
    "ai-mn37:5.5_0": "whether or not the spirit comprehends the Buddha’s statement?”",
    "ai-mn37:6.1_0": "And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappeared in the presence of the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn37:6.1_1": "so too, while the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother appeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three.",
    "ai-mn37:7.1_0": "Now at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park, supplied and provided with a divine orchestra.",
    "ai-mn37:7.2_0": "Seeing Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance,",
    "ai-mn37:7.3_0": "he dismissed the orchestra, approached Mahāmoggallāna, and approached him.",
    "ai-mn37:7.3_1": "and said to him,",
    "ai-mn37:7.4_0": "“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, good sir!",
    "ai-mn37:7.5_0": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.",
    "ai-mn37:7.6_0": "This seat is ready.”",
    "ai-mn37:7.7_0": "Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread out,",
    "ai-mn37:7.8_0": "while Sakka took a low seat and sat to one side.",
    "ai-mn37:7.9_0": "Mahāmoggallāna said to him,",
    "ai-mn37:8.1_0": "“But how does the Buddha understand freedom through the ending of craving?’",
    "ai-mn37:8.2_0": "It’s good that we can listen to the teachings.”",
    "ai-mn37:8.3_0": "“My good Moggallāna, I have many duties, and much to do,",
    "ai-mn37:8.4_0": "not only for myself, but also for the Gods of the Thirty-Three.",
    "ai-mn37:8.5_0": "Besides, I quickly forget even things I’ve properly heard, learned, attended, and memorized.",
    "ai-mn37:8.6_0": "Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.",
    "ai-mn37:8.7_0": "In that battle the gods won and the demons lost.",
    "ai-mn37:8.8_0": "When I returned from that battle as a conqueror, I created the Palace of Victory.",
    "ai-mn37:8.9_0": "The Palace of Victory has a hundred towers.",
    "ai-mn37:8.10_0": "Each tower has seven hundred chambers.",
    "ai-mn37:8.11_0": "Each chamber has seven nymphs.",
    "ai-mn37:8.12_0": "Each nymph has seven maids.",
    "ai-mn37:8.13_0": "Would you like to see the lovely Palace of Victory?”",
    "ai-mn37:8.14_0": "Mahāmoggallāna consented in silence.",
    "ai-mn37:9.1_0": "Then, putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front, Sakka, lord of gods, and Vessavaṇa, the Great King, went to the Palace of Victory.",
    "ai-mn37:9.2_0": "When they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maids,",
    "ai-mn37:9.3_0": "being prudent and discreet, each went to her own bedroom.",
    "ai-mn37:10.1_0": "They were just like a daughter-in-law who is prudent and discreet when they see their father-in-law.",
    "ai-mn37:10.2_0": "In the same way, when they see Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s maids, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.",
    "ai-mn37:10.3_0": "Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying,",
    "ai-mn37:10.4_0": "“See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing!",
    "ai-mn37:10.5_0": "And that lovely thing!”",
    "ai-mn37:10.6_0": "“That looks nice for Venerable Kosiya, just like for someone who has made merit in the past.",
    "ai-mn37:10.7_0": "Humans, when they see something lovely, also say:",
    "ai-mn37:10.8_0": "‘It looks nice enough for the Gods of the Thirty-Three!’",
    "ai-mn37:10.9_0": "That looks nice for Venerable Kosiya, just like for someone who has made merit in the past.”",
    "ai-mn37:11.1_0": "Then Moggallāna thought,",
    "ai-mn37:11.2_0": "“This spirit lives much too negligently.",
    "ai-mn37:11.3_0": "Why don’t I stir up a sense of urgency in him?”",
    "ai-mn37:11.4_0": "Then Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe.",
    "ai-mn37:11.5_0": "Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the Gods of the Thirty-Three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,",
    "ai-mn37:11.6_0": "“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!",
    "ai-mn37:11.7_0": "The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!”",
    "ai-mn37:12.1_0": "Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Moggallāna said to him,",
    "ai-mn37:12.2_0": "“But how does the Buddha understand freedom through the ending of craving?’",
    "ai-mn37:12.3_0": "It’s good that we can listen to the teachings.”",
    "ai-mn37:12.4_0": "“My dear Moggallāna, I approached the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn37:12.4_1": "and bowed down to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn37:12.4_2": "Standing to one side, I said to the Buddha:",
    "ai-mn37:12.5_0": "‘Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?’",
    "ai-mn37:13.1_0": "When I had spoken the Buddha said to me:",
    "ai-mn37:13.2_0": "‘Lord of Gods, it’s when a mendicant has heard:",
    "ai-mn37:13.3_0": "nothing is worth insisting on,",
    "ai-mn37:13.4_0": "When a mendicant has heard that",
    "ai-mn37:13.5_0": "nothing is worth insisting on,",
    "ai-mn37:13.6_0": "they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—",

    "ai-mn37:13.12_0": "That’s how the Buddha briefly explained freedom through the ending of craving to me.”",
    "ai-mn37:14.1_0": "Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Sakka said. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he reappeared in front of Sakka,",
    "ai-mn37:14.1_1": "so too the Buddha disappeared about the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother appeared in front of the Thirty-Three.",
    "ai-mn37:14.2_0": "Soon after Moggallāna left, Sakka’s maids said to him,",
    "ai-mn37:14.3_0": "“Good sir, was that the Blessed One, your Teacher?”",
    "ai-mn37:14.4_0": "“No, it was not.",
    "ai-mn37:14.5_0": "That was my spiritual companion Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.”",
    "ai-mn37:14.6_0": "“You’re fortunate, good sir, so very fortunate,",

    "ai-mn37:14.8_0": "We can’t believe that’s not the Blessed One, your Teacher!”",
    "ai-mn37:15.1_0": "Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn37:15.1_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn37:15.1_2": "Mahāmoggallāna said to him,",

    "ai-mn37:15.3_0": "“I know Sakka, lord of gods, and I am Sakka, the lord of gods.",
