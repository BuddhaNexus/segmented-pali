    "ai-mn91:36.9_0": "Then Brahmāyu saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:",
    "ai-mn91:37.1_0": "“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! ...",
    "ai-mn91:37.2_0": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.",

    "ai-mn91:37.7_0": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Brahmāyu got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
    "ai-mn91:38.1_0": "And when the night had passed Brahmāyu had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,",
    "ai-mn91:38.2_0": "that the meal was ready.",
    "ai-mn91:38.3_0": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu,",
    "ai-mn91:38.3_1": "where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.",
    "ai-mn91:38.4_0": "For seven days, Brahmāyu served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.",

    "ai-mn91:39.2_0": "Not long after the Buddha left, Brahmāyu passed away.",
    "ai-mn91:39.3_0": "Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn91:39.3_1": "After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,",
    "ai-mn91:39.3_2": "Then the Buddha said:",
    "ai-mn91:39.4_0": "“Sir, Brahmāyu has passed away.",
    "ai-mn91:39.5_0": "Where have they been reborn in the next life?”",
    "ai-mn91:39.6_0": "“Mendicants, Brahmāyu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.",
    "ai-mn91:39.7_0": "With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”",
    "ai-mn91:39.8_0": "This is what the Buddha said.",
    "ai-mn91:39.9_0": "Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.",
    "ai-mn91:39.10_0": "The first section on Brahmāyu is finished."
