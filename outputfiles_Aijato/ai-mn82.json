    "ai-mn82:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-mn82:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhita.",
    "ai-mn82:2.1_0": "The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard:",
    "ai-mn82:2.2_0": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.",
    "ai-mn82:2.3_0": "He has this good reputation:",
    "ai-mn82:2.4_0": "‘He is indeed a Master, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Master, the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn82:2.5_0": "With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others.",
    "ai-mn82:2.6_0": "They teach Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.",
    "ai-mn82:2.7_0": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.”",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_0": "Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_1": "After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_2": "While the Buddha were over, they sat down to one side, and said to him:",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_3": "The Buddha said to them:",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_4": "Before sitting down to one side, some of the Buddha and some bowed, while some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_5": "Some of them sat down to one side,",
    "ai-mn82:3.2_0": "When they were seated, the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.",
    "ai-mn82:4.1_0": "Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita, was sitting in that assembly.",

    "ai-mn82:4.4_0": "Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”",
    "ai-mn82:5.1_0": "Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.",
    "ai-mn82:6.1_0": "Soon after they left, Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn82:6.1_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn82:6.1_2": "He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,",

    "ai-mn82:6.5_0": "Please give me the going forth.”",
    "ai-mn82:6.6_0": "“But do you have your parents’ permission?”",
    "ai-mn82:6.7_0": "“No, Sir.”",

    "ai-mn82:6.9_0": "“I’ll make sure, sir, to get my parents’ permission.”",
    "ai-mn82:7.1_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha. Then he went to his parents.",

    "ai-mn82:7.10_0": "For a second time,",
    "ai-mn82:7.11_0": "and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission, but got the same reply.",

    "ai-mn82:15.2_0": "“Sir, I’d like to visit my parents, if the Buddha allows it.”",
    "ai-mn82:15.3_0": "Then the Buddha focused on comprehending Raṭṭhapāla’s mind.",
    "ai-mn82:15.4_0": "When he knew that",
    "ai-mn82:15.5_0": "it was impossible for Raṭṭhapāla to resign the training and return to a lesser life, he said,",
    "ai-mn82:15.6_0": "“Please, Raṭṭhapāla, go at your convenience.”",
    "ai-mn82:16.1_0": "And then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Thullakoṭṭhita.",
    "ai-mn82:16.2_0": "Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika,",
    "ai-mn82:16.3_0": "where he stayed in King Koravya’s deer range.",
    "ai-mn82:16.4_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Thullakoṭṭhita for alms.",
    "ai-mn82:16.5_0": "Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food, he approached his own father’s house.",
    "ai-mn82:17.1_0": "Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla’s father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gate.",
    "ai-mn82:17.2_0": "Raṭṭhapāla’s father saw him coming off in the distance,",

    "ai-mn82:17.5_0": "And at his own father’s home Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusal,",
    "ai-mn82:17.6_0": "but only abuse.",
    "ai-mn82:18.1_0": "Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous night’s porridge.",
    "ai-mn82:18.2_0": "So Raṭṭhapāla said to her,",
    "ai-mn82:18.3_0": "“If that’s to be thrown away, sister, pour it here in my bowl.”",
    "ai-mn82:18.4_0": "As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl, she recognized the features of his hands, feet, and voice.",
    "ai-mn82:18.5_0": "She then went to his mother",
    "ai-mn82:18.5_1": "He went to his mother and said,",

    "ai-mn82:18.7_0": "Master Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”",
    "ai-mn82:18.8_0": "“Wow! If you speak the truth, I’ll make you a free woman!”",
    "ai-mn82:18.9_0": "Raṭṭhapāla’s mother went to his father and said,",
    "ai-mn82:18.9_1": "You said to Raṭṭhapāla,",
    "ai-mn82:18.10_0": "“Please householder, you should know this.",
    "ai-mn82:18.11_0": "It seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”",
    "ai-mn82:19.1_0": "Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last night’s porridge by a wall.",
    "ai-mn82:19.2_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father went up to him.",
    "ai-mn82:19.2_1": "He went to Raṭṭhapāla and said,",
    "ai-mn82:19.3_0": "“But, dear Raṭṭhapāla, isn’t there any porridge!",
    "ai-mn82:19.4_0": "Why not go to your own home?”",
    "ai-mn82:19.5_0": "“Householder, how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house?",
    "ai-mn82:19.6_0": "We’re homeless, householder.",
    "ai-mn82:19.7_0": "I came to your house, but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal,",
    "ai-mn82:19.8_0": "but only abuse.”",
    "ai-mn82:19.9_0": "“Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla, let’s go to the house.”",
    "ai-mn82:19.10_0": "“Enough, householder. My meal is finished for today.”",
    "ai-mn82:19.11_0": "“Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”",
    "ai-mn82:19.12_0": "Raṭṭhapāla consented in silence.",
    "ai-mn82:20.1_0": "Then, knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented, his father went back to his own house.",
    "ai-mn82:20.1_1": "He then had a large heap of gold coins and bullion. Then he addressed Raṭṭhapāla’s former wife,",
    "ai-mn82:20.2_0": "“Please, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorable.”",
    "ai-mn82:21.1_0": "And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapāla’s father had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home, and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying,",
    "ai-mn82:21.2_0": "“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”",
    "ai-mn82:22.1_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to his father’s home.",
    "ai-mn82:22.1_1": "where he sat down on a prepared seat.",
    "ai-mn82:22.1_2": "Raṭṭhapāla’s father, revealing the heap of gold coins and bullion, said to him,",
    "ai-mn82:22.2_0": "“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, this is your maternal fortune. There’s another paternal fortune, and an ancestral one.",
    "ai-mn82:22.3_0": "You can both enjoy your wealth and make merit.",
    "ai-mn82:22.4_0": "Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!”",
    "ai-mn82:22.5_0": "“If you’d follow my advice, householder, you’d have this heap of gold loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges river.",
    "ai-mn82:22.6_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn82:22.7_0": "Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”",
    "ai-mn82:23.1_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives each clasped his feet and said,",
    "ai-mn82:23.2_0": "“What are these nymphs like, sir, for which you lead the spiritual life?”",
    "ai-mn82:23.3_0": "“Sisters, I don’t lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.”",
    "ai-mn82:23.4_0": "Saying, “Our master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us as sisters!” they fainted right away.",
    "ai-mn82:24.1_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla said to his father,",
    "ai-mn82:24.2_0": "“If there is food to be given, householder, please give it.",
