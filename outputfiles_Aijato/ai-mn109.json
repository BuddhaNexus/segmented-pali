    "ai-mn109:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-mn109:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.",
    "ai-mn109:2.1_0": "Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish.",
    "ai-mn109:3.1_0": "Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,",
    "ai-mn109:3.2_0": "“I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”",
    "ai-mn109:3.3_0": "“Well then, mendicant, sit on your own seat.”",
    "ai-mn109:3.4_0": "That mendicant took his seat and said to the Buddha:",
    "ai-mn109:4.1_0": "“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates:",
    "ai-mn109:4.2_0": "form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”",
    "ai-mn109:4.3_0": "“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn109:4.4_0": "form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”",
    "ai-mn109:4.5_0": "Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:",
    "ai-mn109:5.1_0": "“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”",
    "ai-mn109:5.2_0": "“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.”",
    "ai-mn109:6.1_0": "“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”",
    "ai-mn109:6.2_0": "“No, mendicant, that’s not the grasping the same thing as the five grasping aggregates.",
    "ai-mn109:6.3_0": "Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.”",
    "ai-mn109:7.1_0": "“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”",
    "ai-mn109:7.2_0": "“There can,” said the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn109:7.3_0": "“It’s when someone thinks,",
    "ai-mn109:7.4_0": "‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, or such consciousness!’",
    "ai-mn109:7.5_0": "That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”",
    "ai-mn109:8.1_0": "“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”",
    "ai-mn109:8.2_0": "“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form.",
    "ai-mn109:8.3_0": "Any kind of feeling at all ...",
    "ai-mn109:8.4_0": "They truly see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* perception—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’",
    "ai-mn109:8.5_0": "Any kind of choices at all ...",
    "ai-mn109:8.6_0": "Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness.",
    "ai-mn109:8.7_0": "That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.”",
    "ai-mn109:9.1_0": "“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found?",
    "ai-mn109:9.2_0": "What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling ...",
    "ai-mn109:9.3_0": "perception ...",
    "ai-mn109:9.4_0": "What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of choices?",
    "ai-mn109:9.5_0": "What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of consciousness is found?”",
    "ai-mn109:9.6_0": "“Mendicant, they are the four primary elements, and form is the cause of the four primary elements.",

    "ai-mn109:9.10_0": "Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.”",
    "ai-mn109:10.1_0": "“But sir, how does identity view come about?”",
    "ai-mn109:10.2_0": "“It’s because an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.",
    "ai-mn109:10.3_0": "They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.",

    "ai-mn109:10.5_0": "They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.",
    "ai-mn109:10.6_0": "They regard choices as self ...",
    "ai-mn109:10.7_0": "They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.",
    "ai-mn109:10.8_0": "That’s how identity view comes about.”",
    "ai-mn109:11.1_0": "“But sir, how does identity view not come about?”",
    "ai-mn109:11.2_0": "It’s because an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.",
    "ai-mn109:11.3_0": "They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.",
    "ai-mn109:11.4_0": "They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.",

    "ai-mn109:11.8_0": "That’s how identity view does not come about.”",
    "ai-mn109:12.1_0": "“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form,",
    "ai-mn109:12.2_0": "And what is feeling’s gratification, drawback, and escape?",
    "ai-mn109:12.3_0": "perception ...",
    "ai-mn109:12.4_0": "What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to choices?",

    "ai-mn109:12.14_0": "Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.”",
    "ai-mn109:13.1_0": "“But how does one know and see so that the mind is not rid of ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?”",
    "ai-mn109:13.2_0": "“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’",

    "ai-mn109:14.1_0": "Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought,",
    "ai-mn109:14.2_0": "“So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.",
    "ai-mn109:14.3_0": "Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?”",
    "ai-mn109:14.4_0": "But the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:",
    "ai-mn109:14.5_0": "“It’s possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think:",

    "ai-mn109:15.2_0": "Is form permanent or impermanent?”",
    "ai-mn109:15.3_0": "“Impermanent, Sir.”—",
    "ai-mn109:15.4_0": "“But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?”",
    "ai-mn109:15.5_0": "“Suffering, sir.”",

    "ai-mn109:18.1_0": "Being repelled, they become desireless. Because they are desireless, they are freed. When they are freed, they know they are freed.",
    "ai-mn109:18.2_0": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”",

    "ai-mn109:18.4_0": "Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.",
