    "ai-mn89:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Medeḷumpa.",
    "ai-mn89:2.1_0": "Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Townsville on some business.",
    "ai-mn89:2.2_0": "He addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,",
    "ai-mn89:2.3_0": "“My good Kārāyana, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.”",
    "ai-mn89:2.4_0": "“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,",
    "ai-mn89:2.5_0": "“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.",
    "ai-mn89:2.6_0": "at your convenience.”",

    "ai-mn89:3.2_0": "and headed for the park grounds.",
    "ai-mn89:3.3_0": "He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.",
    "ai-mn89:4.1_0": "As he was going for a walk in the park he saw roots of trees that were impressive and inspiring, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.",
    "ai-mn89:4.2_0": "The sight reminded him right away of the Buddha:",
    "ai-mn89:4.3_0": "“These trees are these roots of trees, which are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.”",
    "ai-mn89:4.4_0": "He addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,",

    "ai-mn89:5.2_0": "That’s where the Buddha is now staying.”",
    "ai-mn89:5.3_0": "“But how far away is that town?”",
    "ai-mn89:5.4_0": "“Great king, don’t is hard;",

    "ai-mn89:7.4_0": "For we want to see him.”",
    "ai-mn89:8.1_0": "“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed.",
    "ai-mn89:8.1_1": "where there is little no sound, scorning to enter the Āḷavī.",
    "ai-mn89:8.1_2": "Now you’ll open the door.”",
    "ai-mn89:8.2_0": "The king right away presented his sword and turban to Dīgha Kārāyana,",
    "ai-mn89:8.3_0": "He thought,",
    "ai-mn89:8.4_0": "“Now the king seeks privacy. I should wait here.”",
    "ai-mn89:8.5_0": "Then the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling and knocked, and the Buddha opened the door.",
    "ai-mn89:8.5_1": "The Buddha opened the door",
    "ai-mn89:9.1_0": "Then King Pasenadi entered the Buddha’s dwelling. He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:",
    "ai-mn89:9.2_0": "“Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!",
    "ai-mn89:9.3_0": "I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”",
    "ai-mn89:9.4_0": "“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”",

    "ai-mn89:10.3_0": "It happens, sir, that I see some ascetics and brahmins leading the spiritual life only for a limited period: ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years.",
    "ai-mn89:10.4_0": "Some time later—nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed—they amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.",
    "ai-mn89:10.5_0": "But here I see the mendicants leading the spiritual life entirely full and pure as long as they live, to their last breath.",
    "ai-mn89:10.6_0": "I don’t see any other spiritual life",

    "ai-mn89:11.1_0": "Furthermore, kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.",
    "ai-mn89:11.2_0": "But here I see mendicants live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.",
    "ai-mn89:11.3_0": "I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so harmonious.",

    "ai-mn89:12.3_0": "I thought,",
    "ai-mn89:12.4_0": "‘Clearly these venerables are dissatisfied and leading the spiritual life. There is nothing that has been done.",
    "ai-mn89:12.5_0": "That’s why they’re thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight, you’d think.’",
    "ai-mn89:12.6_0": "I go up to them and say:",
    "ai-mn89:12.7_0": "‘Venerables, why are you so thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight, you’d think?’",

    "ai-mn89:12.9_0": "‘We have jaundice, great king.’",

    "ai-mn89:12.11_0": "I thought,",
    "ai-mn89:12.12_0": "‘Clearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddha’s instructions than they had before.",
    "ai-mn89:12.13_0": "That’s why these venerables are always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.’",

    "ai-mn89:13.1_0": "Furthermore, as an anointed aristocratic king",
    "ai-mn89:13.2_0": "I am able to execute, fine, or banish those who are guilty.",
    "ai-mn89:13.3_0": "Yet when I’m sitting in judgment they interrupt me.",
    "ai-mn89:13.4_0": "I don’t get any kind of speech.",
    "ai-mn89:13.5_0": "to stop interrupting me and wait until I’ve finished speaking.",
    "ai-mn89:13.6_0": "Yet in between them they interrupt me.",
    "ai-mn89:13.7_0": "But here I’ve seen the mendicants",
    "ai-mn89:13.8_0": "while the Buddha is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, and there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.",
    "ai-mn89:13.9_0": "Once it so happened that the Buddha was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.",
    "ai-mn89:13.10_0": "Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.",
    "ai-mn89:13.11_0": "One of their spiritual companions nudged them with their knee, to indicate,",
    "ai-mn89:13.12_0": "‘Hush, venerable, don’t make a sound! Our teacher, the Blessed One, is teaching!’",
    "ai-mn89:13.13_0": "I thought,",
    "ai-mn89:13.14_0": "‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!",
    "ai-mn89:13.15_0": "how an assembly can be so well trained without rod or sword!’",
    "ai-mn89:13.16_0": "I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so well trained.",

    "ai-mn89:14.1_0": "Furthermore, I’ve seen some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters.",
    "ai-mn89:14.1_1": "...",
    "ai-mn89:14.2_0": "They hear:",
    "ai-mn89:14.3_0": "‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’",

    "ai-mn89:14.13_0": "Invariably, they become his disciples.",
