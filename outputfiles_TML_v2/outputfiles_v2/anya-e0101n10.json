    "ai-anya-e0101n10:2_1": "Now, as to the four immaterial states mentioned next to the divine abidings , one who wants firstly to develop the base consisting of boundless space sees in gross physical matter danger through the wielding of sticks, etc., because of the words: “‘It is in virtue of matter that wielding of sticks, wielding of knives, quarrels, brawls and disputes takes place; but that does not exist at all in the immaterial state,’",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:2_2": "and, in this expectation he enters upon the way to dispassion for only material things, for the fading and cessation of only those” ; and he sees danger in it too through the thousand afflictions beginning with eye disease. So, in order to surmount that, he enters upon the fourth jhāna in any one of the nine kasiṇas beginning with the earth kasiṇa and omitting the limited-space kasiṇa.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:3_0": "Now, although he has already surmounted gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere, nevertheless he still wants also to surmount the kasiṇa materiality since it is the counterpart of the former.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:3_1": "Suppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and flees from it as fast as he can, then if he sees in the place he has fled to a palm leaf with a streak painted on it or a creeper or a rope or a crack in the ground, he is fearful, anxious and will not even look at it.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:3_2": "And just as, when a man sees a woman walking together with a man, he thought, “Perhaps there a man of good behavior,” and so he goes to the village with a counselor who were captivating him, his own home, and he wasn’t able to see him. Then he thought,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:4_0": "Herein, this is the explanation of the meaning.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:4_1": "The time when the men were no longer introduced by the snake or as its near enemy. The time of the bhikkhus’ bodies were respectively threatened by the snake and by the enemy.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:4_2": "The time when the bhikkhu surmounts the gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine- material sphere is like the first man’s fleeing as fast as he can and the other man’s going away to another village.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:4_3": "The bhikkhu’s observing that even the matter of the kasiṇa is the counterpart of that gross physical matter and his wanting to surmount that also is like the first man’s seeing in the place he had fled to the palm leaf with a streak painted on it, etc., and the other man’s seeing the man who resembled the enemy in the village he had left, and their unwillingness to look owing to fear and anxiety.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:4_4": "And here the similes of the dog attacked by a boar and that of the pisāca goblin and the timid man should be understood too.",

Then on emerging from the now familiar fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere, he sees the danger in that jhāna in this way: “This makes its object the materiality with which I have become disgusted, and its near enemy,” and “It has joy to see the danger in that peaceful liberation.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:5_2": "There is, however, no comparative grossness of factors here as in the case of the four fine-material jhānas;",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:5_3": "it is just as this wet-nurse,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:6_0": "When he saw the drawbacks there, he brought out the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. He thought, “Will you can give attention to the drawbacks,” and he said, “By’s able to do so,”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:6_1": "When he is removing it, he neither folds it up like a mat nor withdraws it like a cake from a tin. It is simply that he does not advert to it or give attention to it or review it; it is when he neither adverts to it, nor gives attention to it nor reviews it, but gives his attention exclusively to the space touched by it, regarding that as “space,” that he is said to “remove the kasiṇa. ”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:6_2": "And when the kasiṇa is being removed, it does not roll up or roll away. It is simply that it is called “removed” on account of his non-attention to it, his attention being given to “space, space. ” This is conceptualized as the mere space left by the removal of the kasiṇa materiality.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:6_3": "Whether it is called “space left by the removal of the kasiṇa” or “space touched by the kasiṇa,” it is all the same.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:7_0": "When he is teaching the kasiṇa, he thinks, “The sign of foulness is fulfilled, buttermilk from thoughts.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:7_1": "As they do so, their mind becomes immersed in samādhi.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:7_2": "They cultivate, develop, and make much of that foundation.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:7_3": "As he adverts to it again and again, then his consciousness occurs in the space as space, like the consciousness of the base consisting of boundless space.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:7_4": "And here too in the prior stage there are either three or four sensual-sphere impulsions associated with equanimous feeling,",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:7_6": "The remaining kasiṇa is the same as already described.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:8_0": "But while this difference between the gold and thinning in such a place and a bhikkhu, having drunk a pot of blue-bowl and yellowed it, or when a man hanging to the top of water and scorched in a pot, dressing in owl and red-hot boiled in the sky, or even when he has drunk a door-work leather or another’s home, so too, when the bhikkhu places home he was low in that space, he had no more eventually sat down in that wood, etc., as a drope, and so too, after discarding it into that place and looking at it with another body, he had gone beyond the eyes, he had no more even looked at it.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:8_1": "And at this point it is said: ‘With the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, he enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.”",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:9_1": "Herein, complete is in all aspects or of all perceptions; without exception, is the meaning.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:9_2": "Of perceptions of matter: both of the fine-material jhānas mentioned here under the heading of “perception,” and of those things that are their object.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:9_3": "For the jhāna of the fine-material sphere is called “matter” in such passages as “Possessed of visible matter he sees instances of matter” , and it is its object too that is called “matter” in such passages as “He sees instances of visible matter externally ... fair and ugly” .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:9_4": "Form, perception, form, and perception of form:",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:9_5": "Form is what is said:",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:9_6": "So it should be understood that this is also a term for what is classed as the earth kasiṇa, etc., which is the object of that jhāna.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:9_7": "With the surmounting: with the fading away and with the cessation.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:10_0": "Herein, there is no surmounting of these perceptions in one whose greed for the object of those perceptions has not been surmounted as well.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:10_1": "That is why in the Vibhaṅga only the surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the objects is mentioned as follows: “Herein, what are perceptions of matter?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:10_2": "They are the perception, perceiving, perceivedness, in one who has attained a fine- material-sphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life. These are what are called perceptions of matter.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:10_3": "These are the perceptions of form that have passed beyond.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:10_4": "Hence, ‘With the complete surmounting of perceptions of form’ is said” .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:10_5": "Because these attainments have to be reached by surmounting the object; they are not to be reached by retaining the same object as in the first and subsequent jhānas.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:10_6": "That is why it should be understood that the abandoning of the objection should be understood to deal with the surmounting of the object.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:12_2": "Still the mention of them here should be understood as a recommendation of this jhāna for the purpose of arousing interest in it, just as in the case of the fourth jhāna there is mention of the pleasure and pain already abandoned elsewhere, and in this case.",

The perception, perceiving, perceivedness, in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mind- consciousness element in one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mind-consciousness element: these are called ‘perceptions of variety’” —occur with respect to a domain that is varied in individual essence with the variety classed as visible-object, sound, etc.; and secondly, because the forty-four kinds of perception—that is to say, eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable resultant perception, and are dissimilar from each other.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:15_0": "And two things should be understood: firstly, that because the earlier perceptions of matter and perceptions of resistance do not exist even in the kind of existence produced by this jhāna on rebirth,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:15_1": "At that time there are two life-spans longings and surmounting, namely, with the previous disappearance of their states.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:15_2": "and secondly, in the case of perceptions of variety, “non-attention” to them is said because twenty-seven kinds of perception—that is to say, eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable perception, nine kinds of functional perception, and ten kinds of unprofitable perception—still exist in the kind of existence produced by this jhāna.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:15_3": "For even while they live in this monastery, they enter and remain in the same meditation subject as arouseon.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:16_0": "And here briefly it should be understood that the abandoning of all fine- material-sphere states is signless in all ways too.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:16_1": "and the abandoning of and non-attention to all sense-spheres should be understood to perceptions of variety of perceptions of resentment, and perceptions of variety.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:39_1": "They cultivate, develop, and make much of that foundation.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:39_2": "As he does so, consciousness belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception arises in absorption making its object the four mental aggregates that constitute the attainment of the dimension of nothingness.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:39_3": "But the method of explaining the process of absorption should be understood in the way already described.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:39_4": "And at this point it is said: “By completely surmounting the dimension of nothingness he enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:40_3": "For the object too is “nothingness” in the way already stated, and then because it is the object of the third immaterial jhāna, it is its “base” in the sense of habitat, as the “deities’ base” is for deities, thus it is the “base consisting of nothingness.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:40_4": "Likewise: it is “boundless space,” and then, because of the sense of locality of nothingness, because of the fine-material jhānas, which is the “base” in the sense of locality of the dimension of nothingness, thus it is the “base consisting of nothingness.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:40_5": "So it should be understood that the words, “By ... surmounting the base consisting of nothingness” include both the jhāna and its object together, since this base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:41_0": "Base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception: then there is he who so practices that there is in him the perception on account of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, thus it is called the “the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception” .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:41_1": "and in the Vibhaṅga, in order to point out that person, firstly one specified as “neither percipient nor non-percipient,” it is said, “gives attention to that same base consisting of nothingness as peaceful, he develops the attainment with residual formations, hence ‘neither percipient nor non-percipient’.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:41_2": "Herein, when he gives attention to it, there is no simply this meditation subject, it does not appear to him as object, there is no attention to him when he gives his attention to the meditation subject, there is, no simply this object, it does not appear to him as peaceful.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:42_0": "If he gives attention to it as “peaceful” then how does there come to be?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:42_1": "Because there is no actual desire to attain it.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:42_2": "For although he gives attention to it as “peaceful,” yet there is no concern in him or reaction or attention such as “I shall advert to this” or “I shall resolve upon the duration of this.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:42_3": "Because the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is more peaceful and better than the base consisting of nothingness.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:43_0": "Suppose a king is proceeding along a city street with the great pomp of royalty, splendidly mounted on the back of an elephant, and he sees craftsmen wearing one cloth tightly as a loin-cloth and another tied round their heads, working at the various crafts, etc., and their limbs covered with ivory dust. When it is such as ivory carving, etc.; now while a craft-master think, “How skilled these craft-masters, and what crafts they practice!” he does not, however, think, “Oh that I might abandon royalty and become a craftsman like that!”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:43_1": "Why is that?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:43_2": "Because of the great benefit of the majesty of kingship,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:43_3": "he leaves the craftsmen behind and proceeds on his way.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:43_4": "In the same way, although he gives attention to it as “peaceful,” then, when he focuses on that meditation subject, he thinks: “I shall advert to it, I shall advert to it or to report to mind.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:44_0": "As he gives attention to it as “peaceful” in the way already described, he reaches the ultra-subtle absorbed perception in virtue of which he is called “neither percipient nor non-percipient,” and it is said of him that “He develops the attainment with residual formations.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:44_1": "The attainment with residual formations, having reached a state of extreme subtlety, whose formations have reached a state of extreme subtlety.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:45_0": "287.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:45_1": "Now, in order to show the meaning of the kind of perception that has been reached, on account of which this jhāna is called the “base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception,” it is said: “Here, in one who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception or in one who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this very life” .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:45_2": "For someone who has attained the one who has attained the Dhamma and the higher mind are mental,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:45_3": "The word meaning here is this: that jhāna with its associated states neither has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of gross perception and the presence of subtle perception,",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:46_3": "And the meaning should be illustrated by the similes beginning with the smearing of oil on the bowl.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:47_5": "so too, perception and choices aren’t present in them.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:48_0": "But in this context what is perception’s function?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:48_1": "the change of the objects and to the enlightenment factor (of the knowledge), and then having destroyed insight,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n10:48_2": "For I wouldn’t recognize them for the sake of funeral pyre, but focusing on the fire element.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n10:50_0": "And this meaning should be illustrated not only by these similes but by other appropriate ones as well.",
