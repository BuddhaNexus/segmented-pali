When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.",

    "ai-mn19:26.1_0": "I’ve made up this simile to make a point.",
    "ai-mn19:26.2_0": "And this is what it means.",
