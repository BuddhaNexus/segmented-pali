    "ai-mn82:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhita.",
    "ai-mn82:2.1_0": "The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard:",

    "ai-mn82:2.4_0": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
    "ai-mn82:2.5_0": "He realizes with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.",
    "ai-mn82:2.6_0": "He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.",
    "ai-mn82:2.7_0": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.”",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_0": "Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn82:3.1_1": "some, after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, sat down on one side.",

    "ai-mn82:17.4_0": "“Our dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings, these fake ascetics!”",
    "ai-mn82:17.5_0": "And at his own father’s home Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusal,",

    "ai-mn82:18.1_0": "Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous night’s porridge.",
    "ai-mn82:18.2_0": "Raṭṭhapāla said to her,",
    "ai-mn82:18.3_0": "“If that’s to be thrown away, sister, pour it here in my bowl.”",
    "ai-mn82:18.4_0": "As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl, she recognized the features of his hands, feet, and voice.",
    "ai-mn82:18.5_0": "She then went to his mother and father.",
    "ai-mn82:18.5_1": "and after approaching he said this to venerable Raṭṭhapāla:",

    "ai-mn82:19.1_0": "Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last night’s porridge by a wall.",
    "ai-mn82:19.2_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father went up to him,",
    "ai-mn82:19.2_1": "and after approaching he said this to venerable Raṭṭhapāla:",
    "ai-mn82:19.3_0": "“Dear Raṭṭhapāla! There’s ... and youʼll be eating last night’s porridge!",

    "ai-mn82:19.5_0": "“Householder, how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house?",
    "ai-mn82:19.6_0": "We’re homeless, householder.",
    "ai-mn82:19.7_0": "I came to your house, but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal,",

    "ai-mn82:19.11_0": "“Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, consent tomorrow.”",
    "ai-mn82:19.12_0": "Raṭṭhapāla consented in silence.",
    "ai-mn82:20.1_0": "Then, knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented, his father went back to his own home.",
    "ai-mn82:20.1_1": "where he went to the great goldsmith’s gold coins and bullion stored it under mats and bullion. He said to Raṭṭhapāla,",

    "ai-mn82:21.1_0": "And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapāla’s father had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home, and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying,",
    "ai-mn82:21.2_0": "“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”",

    "ai-mn82:22.6_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn82:22.7_0": "Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”",
    "ai-mn82:23.1_0": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives each clasped his feet and said,",
    "ai-mn82:23.2_0": "“What are these nymphs like, sir, for which you lead the spiritual life?”",
