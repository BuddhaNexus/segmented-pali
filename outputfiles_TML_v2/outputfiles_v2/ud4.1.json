    "ai-ud4.1:1.4_0": "Then venerable Meghiya went to the Fortunate One,",

    "ai-ud4.1:12.2_0": "This is the first thing ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:13.1_0": "Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.",
    "ai-ud4.1:13.2_0": "This is the second thing ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:14.1_0": "Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or difficulty. It leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.",
    "ai-ud4.1:14.2_0": "talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.",
    "ai-ud4.1:14.3_0": "Such talk as this he gains as he desires, he gains without difficulty, gains without trouble.",
    "ai-ud4.1:14.4_0": "This is the third thing ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:15.1_0": "Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.",
    "ai-ud4.1:15.2_0": "This is the fourth thing ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:16.1_0": "Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.",
    "ai-ud4.1:16.2_0": "This is the fifth thing ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:16.3_0": "These are the five things that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, help it ripen.",
    "ai-ud4.1:17.1_0": "A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be ethical ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:18.1_0": "A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:18.2_0": "talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.",
    "ai-ud4.1:18.3_0": "Such talk as this he gains as he desires, he gains without difficulty, gains without trouble.",
    "ai-ud4.1:19.1_0": "A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be energetic ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:20.1_0": "A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be wise ...",
    "ai-ud4.1:21.1_0": "But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things.",
    "ai-ud4.1:21.2_0": "You should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up malicious thoughts, and mindfulness of breathing to give up cruel thoughts.",
    "ai-ud4.1:21.3_0": "When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized. Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.”",
    "ai-ud4.1:22.1_0": "Then, knowing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:",
    "ai-ud4.1:23.1_0": "“With thoughts whether low or fine,",
    "ai-ud4.1:23.2_0": "excitement in the mind arises.",
    "ai-ud4.1:23.3_0": "Not understanding these thoughts in the mind,",
    "ai-ud4.1:23.4_0": "one with mind astray runs all over the place.",
    "ai-ud4.1:24.1_0": "Having understood these thoughts in the mind,",
    "ai-ud4.1:24.2_0": "an awakened one—keen, restrained, and mindful—",
    "ai-ud4.1:24.3_0": "that has arisen in the mind-made.",
