When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.",
    "ai-mn71:8.1_0": "And whenever I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn ...",
    "ai-mn71:8.1_1": "and I understand how beings are reborn according to their (good and bad) actions.",
    "ai-mn71:9.1_0": "And I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.",
