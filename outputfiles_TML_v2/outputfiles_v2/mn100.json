He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.",

    "ai-mn100:9.5_0": "Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.",
    "ai-mn100:9.6_0": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace.",
