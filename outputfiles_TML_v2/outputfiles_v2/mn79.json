    "ai-mn79:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.",
    "ai-mn79:1.3_0": "Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyī was residing at the monastery of the wanderers.",
    "ai-mn79:2.1_0": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.",
    "ai-mn79:2.2_0": "Then it occurred to him,",
    "ai-mn79:2.3_0": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.",
    "ai-mn79:2.4_0": "Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”",
    "ai-mn79:2.5_0": "Then the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.",
    "ai-mn79:3.1_0": "Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as",
    "ai-mn79:3.2_0": "talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.",
    "ai-mn79:3.3_0": "Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,",

    "ai-mn79:5.1_0": "“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.",
    "ai-mn79:5.2_0": "It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.",
    "ai-mn79:5.3_0": "When I don’t come to the assembly, they sit and engage in all kinds of unworthy talk.",

    "ai-mn79:6.1_0": "“Well then, Udāyī, suggest something for me to talk about.”",
    "ai-mn79:6.2_0": "“Master Gotama, a few days ago someone was claiming to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’",
    "ai-mn79:6.3_0": "When I asked a question, I answered the question, and distracted the discussion with irrelevant points. And he displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.",

    "ai-mn79:6.5_0": "‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’”",
    "ai-mn79:6.6_0": "“But Udāyī, who was it that made such a claim and behaved in such a way?”",
    "ai-mn79:6.7_0": "“It was Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, sir.”",
    "ai-mn79:7.1_0": "“Udāyī, someone who recollects their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.",
    "ai-mn79:7.1_1": "They might ask me a question about the past, or I might ask them a question about the past.",

    "ai-mn79:7.4_0": "And they might satisfy me with their answer, or I might satisfy them with my answer.",
    "ai-mn79:7.5_0": "Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the past and the future.",

    "ai-mn79:8.4_0": "How should I possibly, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn, like the Buddha?",
    "ai-mn79:8.5_0": "But then the Buddha told me,",
    "ai-mn79:8.6_0": "‘Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the past and the future.",

    "ai-mn79:8.10_0": "Perhaps I might satisfy the Buddha by answering a question about my own teacher’s doctrine.”",
    "ai-mn79:9.1_0": "“But Udāyī, what is your own teacher’s doctrine?”",
    "ai-mn79:9.2_0": "“Sir, it’s this:",
    "ai-mn79:9.3_0": "‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’”",
    "ai-mn79:9.4_0": "“But Udāyī, when you think this:",
    "ai-mn79:9.5_0": "‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’”",
    "ai-mn79:9.6_0": "“Sir, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”",

    "ai-mn79:9.8_0": "“Sir, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”",
    "ai-mn79:10.1_0": "“Udāyī, you could draw this out for a long time.",

    "ai-mn79:10.4_0": "‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her that I desire!’",
    "ai-mn79:10.5_0": "They’d say to him:",
    "ai-mn79:10.6_0": "‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker?’",
    "ai-mn79:10.7_0": "Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’",
    "ai-mn79:10.8_0": "They’d say to him:",
    "ai-mn79:10.9_0": "‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether",
    "ai-mn79:10.9_1": "whether he’s tall or short, long or medium;",
    "ai-mn79:10.9_2": "in such and such a village or town.’",
    "ai-mn79:10.10_0": "Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’",

    "ai-mn79:10.13_0": "Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’",
    "ai-mn79:10.14_0": "What do you think, Udāyī?",
    "ai-mn79:10.15_0": "This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”",
    "ai-mn79:10.16_0": "“Clearly that’s the case, sir.”",
    "ai-mn79:10.17_0": "“In the same way, you say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.”",
    "ai-mn79:11.1_0": "“Sir, suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. Such is the splendor of the self that is sound after death.”",
    "ai-mn79:12.1_0": "“What do you think, Udāyī?",
    "ai-mn79:12.2_0": "Which of these two has a finer splendor: such a beryl gem, or a firefly in the dark of night?”",
    "ai-mn79:12.3_0": "“A firefly in the dark of night, sir.”",
    "ai-mn79:13.1_0": "“What do you think, Udāyī?",
