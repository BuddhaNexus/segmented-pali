    "ai-ud1.10:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-ud1.10:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
    "ai-ud1.10:1.3_0": "Now at that time Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth was residing by Suppāraka on the ocean shore, where he was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.",
    "ai-ud1.10:1.4_0": "Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,",
    "ai-ud1.10:1.5_0": "“I am one of those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:2.1_0": "Then a deity who was a former relative of Bāhiya, having compassion and wanting what’s best for him, approached him.",
    "ai-ud1.10:2.1_1": "and after going, he said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe:",
    "ai-ud1.10:2.2_0": "“You’re neither perfected nor have someone on the path to perfection.",
    "ai-ud1.10:2.3_0": "You don’t have the practice by which you might become a perfected one or one on the path to perfection.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:3.1_0": "“Then who exactly are those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection?”",
    "ai-ud1.10:3.2_0": "“There is, Bāhiya, in the northern countries a city by the name of Sāvatthī.",
    "ai-ud1.10:3.3_0": "There that Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.",
    "ai-ud1.10:3.4_0": "Because the Buddha is perfected and perfected.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:4.1_0": "Impelled by that deity, Bāhiya left Suppāraka right away.",
    "ai-ud1.10:4.2_0": "Sojourning no more than a single night in any place, he made his way to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery in the Jeta Grove at Sāvatthī.",
    "ai-ud1.10:4.3_0": "At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.",
    "ai-ud1.10:4.4_0": "Bāhiya approached them and said,",
    "ai-ud1.10:4.5_0": "“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?",
    "ai-ud1.10:4.6_0": "For I want to see him.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:4.7_0": "“The Buddha has entered Bāhiya’s house.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:5.1_0": "Then Bāhiya rushed out of the Jeta Grove and entered Sāvatthī, where he saw the Buddha walking for alms. He was impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties.",
    "ai-ud1.10:5.2_0": "After seeing (him), he went to the Fortunate One,",
    "ai-ud1.10:5.2_1": "and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One:",
    "ai-ud1.10:5.3_0": "“Sir, let the Buddha teach me the Dhamma!",
    "ai-ud1.10:5.4_0": "That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:5.5_0": "The Buddha said this:",
    "ai-ud1.10:5.6_0": "“It’s not the time, Bāhiya, so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfood.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:6.1_0": "For a second time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Fortunate One:",
    "ai-ud1.10:6.2_0": "“But you never know, sir, when life is at risk, either the Buddha’s or my own.",
    "ai-ud1.10:6.3_0": "Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma!",
    "ai-ud1.10:6.4_0": "That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:6.5_0": "For a second time, the Buddha said,",
    "ai-ud1.10:6.6_0": "“It’s not the time, Bāhiya, so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfood.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:7.1_0": "For a third time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Fortunate One:",
    "ai-ud1.10:7.2_0": "“But you never know, sir, when life is at risk, either the Buddha’s or my own.",
    "ai-ud1.10:7.3_0": "Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma!",
    "ai-ud1.10:7.4_0": "That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:8.1_0": "“In that case, Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus:",
    "ai-ud1.10:8.2_0": "‘In the seen will be merely the seen; in the heard will be merely the heard; in the thought will be merely the thought; in the known will be merely the known.’",
    "ai-ud1.10:8.3_0": "That’s how you should train.",
    "ai-ud1.10:8.4_0": "When you have trained in this way, you won’t be ‘by that’.",
    "ai-ud1.10:8.5_0": "When you’re not ‘by that’, you won’t be ‘in that’.",
    "ai-ud1.10:8.6_0": "When you’re not ‘in that’, you won’t be in this world or the world beyond or in between the two.",
    "ai-ud1.10:8.7_0": "Just this is the end of suffering.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:9.1_0": "Then Bāhiya’s mind was freed from the corruptions without grasping.",
    "ai-ud1.10:10.1_0": "And when the Buddha had given Bāhiya this brief advice he left.",
    "ai-ud1.10:10.2_0": "But soon after the Buddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at Bāhiya and took his life.",
    "ai-ud1.10:11.1_0": "Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, the Buddha left the city of Benares. He saw that the mendicants had died.",
    "ai-ud1.10:11.2_0": "he addressed the mendicants:",
    "ai-ud1.10:11.3_0": "“Mendicants, pick up Bāhiya’s corpse.",
    "ai-ud1.10:11.4_0": "Having lifted it onto a cot and carried it, cremate it",
    "ai-ud1.10:11.5_0": "and make a Shrine for the language.",
    "ai-ud1.10:11.6_0": "Your spiritual companions have passed away.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.1_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They did as the Buddha asked, then returned to the Buddha",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.1_1": "After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.2_0": "They did as he asked.",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.3_0": "“Sir, Bāhiya’s corpse has been cremated and a monument built for him.",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.4_0": "Where have they been reborn in the next life?”",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.5_0": "“Mendicants, Bāhiya was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.6_0": "and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma.",
    "ai-ud1.10:12.7_0": "Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth has become fully extinguished.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:13.1_0": "Then, knowing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:",
    "ai-ud1.10:14.1_0": "“Where water and earth,",
    "ai-ud1.10:14.2_0": "fire and air find no footing;",
    "ai-ud1.10:14.3_0": "There they do not burn,",
    "ai-ud1.10:14.4_0": "nor does the sun shed its light;",
    "ai-ud1.10:14.5_0": "there the moon glows not,",
    "ai-ud1.10:14.6_0": "yet no darkness is found.",
    "ai-ud1.10:15.1_0": "And when a sage, a brahmin, finds understanding",
    "ai-ud1.10:15.2_0": "a sage, a brahmin,",
    "ai-ud1.10:15.3_0": "then from forms and formless,",
    "ai-ud1.10:15.4_0": "from pleasure and pain they are released.”",
    "ai-ud1.10:15.5_0": "The tenth (story)",
    "ai-ud1.10:16.1_0": "This exalted utterance was also said by the Fortunate One, so I have heard.",
