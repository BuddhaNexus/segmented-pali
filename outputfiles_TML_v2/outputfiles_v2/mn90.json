    "ai-mn90:10.1_0": "“I didn’t ask the Buddha about this.",
    "ai-mn90:10.2_0": "but about the life to come.”",

    "ai-mn90:10.7_0": "What five?",
    "ai-mn90:10.8_0": "It’s when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:",
    "ai-mn90:10.9_0": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
    "ai-mn90:10.10_0": "He is rarely ill or unwell. His stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.",
    "ai-mn90:10.11_0": "They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.",
    "ai-mn90:10.12_0": "They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.",
    "ai-mn90:10.13_0": "They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.",
    "ai-mn90:10.14_0": "These are the five factors that support meditation.",
    "ai-mn90:10.15_0": "There are these four classes:",
    "ai-mn90:10.16_0": "aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.",
    "ai-mn90:10.17_0": "If they had these five factors that support meditation,",
    "ai-mn90:10.18_0": "that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”",

    "ai-mn90:11.3_0": "If they had these five factors that support meditation,",
    "ai-mn90:11.4_0": "would there be any difference between them?”",
    "ai-mn90:11.5_0": "“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their efforts in meditation.",
    "ai-mn90:11.6_0": "Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horse or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.",
    "ai-mn90:11.7_0": "What do you think, Great King,",
    "ai-mn90:11.8_0": "Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed?”",
    "ai-mn90:11.9_0": "“Yes, Venerable Sir.”",

    "ai-mn90:11.12_0": "“In the same way, there are things that must be attained by someone with faith, health, integrity, energy, and wisdom. It’s not possible for a faithless, unhealthy, deceitful, lazy, witless person to attain them.”",

    "ai-mn90:12.4_0": "If they had these five factors that support meditation, and if they practiced rightly,",
    "ai-mn90:12.5_0": "would there be any difference between them?”",
    "ai-mn90:12.6_0": "“In that case, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.",

    "ai-mn90:12.8_0": "another used wood,",
    "ai-mn90:12.9_0": "another used mango wood,",
    "ai-mn90:12.10_0": "while another used wood of the cluster fig.",

    "ai-mn90:12.13_0": "“No, Sir.”",
    "ai-mn90:12.14_0": "“In the same way, great king, that’s why I say that any difference between you and freedom is effective, I don’t say.”",
    "ai-mn90:13.1_0": "“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.",
    "ai-mn90:13.2_0": "But sir, do gods absolutely exist?”",
    "ai-mn90:13.3_0": "“But great king, why do you say this?”",
    "ai-mn90:13.4_0": "‘But sir, do gods exist?’”",
    "ai-mn90:13.5_0": "“Whether those gods come back to this state of existence or not.”",
    "ai-mn90:13.6_0": "“Great king, those gods who are free of affliction come back to this state of existence are free of affliction.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.1_0": "When he said this, General Viḍūḍabha said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn90:14.2_0": "“Sir, will the gods subject to affliction topple or expel from their place the gods who are free of affliction?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.3_0": "Then it occurred to him,",
    "ai-mn90:14.4_0": "“Nigaṇṭha General Viḍūḍabha has come to King Pasenadi.",

    "ai-mn90:14.6_0": "Now is the time for one son to confer with another.”",
    "ai-mn90:14.7_0": "So Ānanda addressed General Viḍūḍabha,",

    "ai-mn90:14.22_0": "“King Pasenadi can’t even see the gods of the Thirty-Three, so how could he possibly topple or expel them from their place?”",
    "ai-mn90:14.23_0": "“In the same way, there are gods who are free of affliction, and those gods who are free of affliction do not come back to this state of existence. They are no more of gods and humans.",
    "ai-mn90:14.23_1": "So how could they possibly topple or renunciates?”",
    "ai-mn90:15.1_0": "Then the king said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn90:15.2_0": "“What is the name of this monk?”",
    "ai-mn90:15.3_0": "“Ānanda, great king.”",
    "ai-mn90:15.4_0": "“A joy he is, and a joy he seems!",
    "ai-mn90:15.5_0": "What Venerable Ānanda says seems reasonable.",
    "ai-mn90:15.6_0": "But sir, does Brahmā absolutely exist?”",
    "ai-mn90:15.7_0": "“But great king, why do you say this?”",
    "ai-mn90:15.8_0": "But sir, does Brahmā absolutely exist?”",
