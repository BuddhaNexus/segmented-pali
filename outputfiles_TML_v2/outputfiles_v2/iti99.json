    "ai-iti99:3.1_0": "For how can I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching, not by mere oral recitation?",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_0": "It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is:",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_1": "ʻThere I had such a name, such a family, such appearance, such food, such experience of happiness and suffering, and such a life-span.",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_2": "passing away from there I arose in another state of existence,",
    "ai-iti99:3.2_3": "and there I had such a name, such a family, such appearance, such food, such experience of happiness and suffering, and such a life-span.",

When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.",

When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.",
