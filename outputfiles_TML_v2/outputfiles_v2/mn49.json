    "ai-mn49:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-mn49:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
    "ai-mn49:1.3_0": "There he addressed the mendicants,",
    "ai-mn49:1.4_0": "“ mendicants!”",
    "ai-mn49:1.5_0": "“Venerable Sir,” they replied.",
    "ai-mn49:1.6_0": "The Buddha said this:",
    "ai-mn49:2.1_0": "“At one time, mendicants, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.",
    "ai-mn49:2.2_0": "Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:",
    "ai-mn49:2.3_0": "‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’",
    "ai-mn49:3.1_0": "Just then I read the mind of Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:3.2_0": "Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappeared in the presence of the Buddha in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.",
    "ai-mn49:3.2_1": "so too, while the Buddha had vanished from Sālavatī at that time, he appeared in that Brahmā realm.",
    "ai-mn49:3.3_0": "Baka saw me coming off in the distance",
    "ai-mn49:3.4_0": "and after seeing (him), he said this to me:",
    "ai-mn49:3.5_0": "‘Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir!",
    "ai-mn49:3.6_0": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.",
    "ai-mn49:3.7_0": "For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable.",
    "ai-mn49:3.7_1": "For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’",
    "ai-mn49:4.1_0": "So I said to him,",
    "ai-mn49:4.2_0": "‘Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance!",
    "ai-mn49:4.3_0": "Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable.",
    "ai-mn49:4.4_0": "And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that",
    "ai-mn49:4.5_0": "there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.",
    "ai-mn49:4.6_0": "And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.’",
    "ai-mn49:5.1_0": "Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmā’s retinue and said this to me,",
    "ai-mn49:5.2_0": "‘Mendicant, mendicant! Don’t attack this one! Don’t attack this one! For this is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.",
    "ai-mn49:5.3_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who criticized and loathed earth, water, air, fire, creatures, gods, the Creator, and Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.4_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.",
    "ai-mn49:5.5_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who praised and approved earth, water, air, fire, creatures, gods, the Creator, and Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.6_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.",
    "ai-mn49:5.7_0": "So, mendicant, I say this:",
    "ai-mn49:5.8_0": "please, good sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.9_0": "If you do, then the consequence for you will be like that of a person who, when Lady Luck approaches, wards her off with a staff, or someone who shoves away the ground as they fall down the chasm into hell.",
    "ai-mn49:5.10_0": "Please, dear sir, do exactly what Brahmā says. Don’t go beyond the word of Brahmā.",
    "ai-mn49:5.11_0": "Do you not see the assembly of Brahmā gathered here?’",
    "ai-mn49:5.12_0": "And that is how Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of Brahmā to me as an example.",
    "ai-mn49:6.1_0": "When he had spoken, I said to Māra,",
    "ai-mn49:6.2_0": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,",
    "ai-mn49:6.3_0": "“He doesn’t know me.”",
    "ai-mn49:6.4_0": "You are Māra the Wicked.",
    "ai-mn49:6.5_0": "And Brahmā, Brahmā’s assembly, and his retinue have all fallen into your hands; they’re under your sway.",
    "ai-mn49:6.6_0": "For you think,",
    "ai-mn49:6.7_0": "“Maybe this one, too, has fallen into my hands; maybe he’s under my sway!”",
    "ai-mn49:6.8_0": "But I didn’t go under your sway.’",
    "ai-mn49:7.1_0": "When I had spoken, Baka the Brahmā said to me,",
    "ai-mn49:7.2_0": "‘But, good sir, what I say is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable is in fact permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. And where I say there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn there is in fact",
    "ai-mn49:7.3_0": "there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.",
    "ai-mn49:7.4_0": "And when I say there’s no other escape beyond this there is in fact no other escape beyond this.",
    "ai-mn49:7.5_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you, mendicant, whose self-mortification lasted as long as your entire life.",
    "ai-mn49:7.6_0": "When there was another escape beyond this they knew it, and when there was no other escape beyond this, they knew it.",
    "ai-mn49:7.7_0": "So, mendicant, I say this:",
    "ai-mn49:7.8_0": "“I will not see any other escape beyond my defilements. But if you will live withdrawn, there will be no distress for you.",
    "ai-mn49:7.9_0": "If you attach to earth, you will lie close to me, in my domain, vulnerable and expendable.",

    "ai-mn49:9.10_0": "“That’s how powerful is Baka the Brahmā, how illustrious and mighty.”’",
    "ai-mn49:10.1_0": "But there is another realm that you don’t know or see.",
    "ai-mn49:10.2_0": "I know that",
    "ai-mn49:10.3_0": "There is the realm named after the gods of streaming radiance. You passed away from there and were reborn here.",

    "ai-mn49:10.5_0": "I know that",

    "ai-mn49:10.10_0": "So Brahmā, I am not your equal in knowledge, still less your inferior.",

    "ai-mn49:26.1_0": "Well look now, good sir, I will vanish from you!’",
    "ai-mn49:26.2_0": "‘All right, then, Brahmā, vanish from me—if you can.’",
    "ai-mn49:26.3_0": "Then Baka the Brahmā said,",

    "ai-mn49:27.3_0": "I didn’t welcome any kind of existence,",
    "ai-mn49:27.4_0": "and didn’t grasp at relishing.’",
    "ai-mn49:28.1_0": "Then Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,",
    "ai-mn49:28.2_0": "‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!",
    "ai-mn49:28.3_0": "The ascetic Gotama has such psychic power and might! We’ve never before seen or heard of any other ascetic or brahmin with psychic power and might like the ascetic Gotama, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan.",
    "ai-mn49:28.4_0": "Though people enjoy continued existence, loving it so much, he has extracted it, root and all.’",
    "ai-mn49:29.1_0": "Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmā’s retinue and said this to me,",
    "ai-mn49:29.2_0": "‘If such is your understanding, good sir, do not present it to your disciples or those gone forth!",

    "ai-mn49:29.4_0": "Do not wish this for your disciples or those gone forth!",
    "ai-mn49:29.5_0": "There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.",
    "ai-mn49:29.6_0": "They presented, taught, and wished this for their disciples and those gone forth.",
    "ai-mn49:29.7_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.",
    "ai-mn49:29.8_0": "And that mendicant, before those ascetics and brahmins who claim to be fully awakened Buddhas in the world,",
    "ai-mn49:29.9_0": "They did not present, teach, or wish this for their disciples and those gone forth.",
    "ai-mn49:29.10_0": "When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.",
    "ai-mn49:29.11_0": "So, mendicant, I tell you this:",
    "ai-mn49:29.12_0": "please, good sir, remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life, for this is better left unsaid. Good sir, do not instruct others.’",
    "ai-mn49:30.1_0": "When he had spoken, I said to Māra,",
    "ai-mn49:30.2_0": "‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,",
    "ai-mn49:30.3_0": "“He doesn’t know me.”",
    "ai-mn49:30.4_0": "You are Māra the Wicked.",
    "ai-mn49:30.5_0": "Then you don’t say such a thing.",
    "ai-mn49:30.6_0": "out of compassion for me, Wicked One!",
    "ai-mn49:30.7_0": "For you think,",
    "ai-mn49:30.8_0": "“Those who the ascetic Gotama teaches will go beyond my reach.”",
    "ai-mn49:30.9_0": "Those who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened Buddhas.",
    "ai-mn49:30.10_0": "But I claim to be a fully awakened Buddha.",
    "ai-mn49:30.11_0": "For the Realized One teaches like this.",
    "ai-mn49:30.12_0": "The Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciples.",
    "ai-mn49:30.13_0": "Why is that?",
    "ai-mn49:30.14_0": "Because the Realized One has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.",
    "ai-mn49:30.15_0": "He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.",
    "ai-mn49:30.16_0": "Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,",
    "ai-mn49:30.17_0": "the Realized One has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.",
    "ai-mn49:30.18_0": "He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.’",
    "ai-mn49:31.1_0": "And so, because of the silencing of Māra, and because of the invitation of Brahmā, the name of this discussion is “On the Invitation of Brahmā”.",
    "ai-mn49:31.2_0": "The ninth section on the supreme penalty is finished."
