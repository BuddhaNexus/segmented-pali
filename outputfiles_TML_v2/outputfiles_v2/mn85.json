    "ai-mn85:2.1_0": "At this time Prince Bodhi had recently built the Kokanada stilt house. It had not yet been inhabited by any ascetic or brahmin, or anyone else.",
    "ai-mn85:3.1_0": "Then Prince Bodhi addressed the student Sañjikāputta,",
    "ai-mn85:3.2_0": "saying: “Go, dear Sañjikāputta, and approach the Fortunate One,",
    "ai-mn85:3.2_1": "and after approaching, worshipping the Buddha’s feet in my name, strong, and living comfortably.",

    "ai-mn85:4.3_0": "“Prince Bodhi, dear Gotama, worships with his head at ease.",

    "ai-mn85:5.5_0": "saying: “It is time, dear Gotama, the meal is ready.”",
    "ai-mn85:6.1_0": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s home.",

    "ai-mn85:7.3_0": "he went out to meet him, bowed down to him, and went to the Kokanada stilt house with the Buddha in front.",
    "ai-mn85:7.4_0": "Then the Fortunate One stood near the last step on the staircase.",
    "ai-mn85:7.5_0": "Then Prince Bodhi said this to the Fortunate One:",

    "ai-mn85:11.1_0": "Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.",
    "ai-mn85:11.2_0": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace.",
    "ai-mn85:11.2_1": "I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",

    "ai-mn85:11.7_0": "I quickly memorized that teaching.",
    "ai-mn85:11.8_0": "So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.",

    "ai-mn85:11.11_0": "Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.1_0": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:12.2_0": "‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’",
    "ai-mn85:12.3_0": "When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.",
    "ai-mn85:12.4_0": "Then, Prince, this occurred to me:",

    "ai-mn85:12.11_0": "I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.",
    "ai-mn85:12.12_0": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,",
    "ai-mn85:12.13_0": "‘Reverend Kālāma, have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point, and declare having achieved it?’",
    "ai-mn85:12.14_0": "‘He had, reverend.’",

    "ai-mn85:12.17_0": "to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!",

    "ai-mn85:12.22_0": "Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’",

    "ai-mn85:12.24_0": "Then, Prince, this occurred to me:",
    "ai-mn85:12.25_0": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’",
    "ai-mn85:12.26_0": "Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.",
    "ai-mn85:12.27_0": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace.",
    "ai-mn85:12.27_1": "and after approaching, I said this to Uddaka Rāmaputta:",

    "ai-mn85:25.6_0": "so too, Prince, out-breaths and out-breaths became interest.",
    "ai-mn85:25.7_0": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.",

    "ai-mn85:28.10_1": "so did the skin on my head become withered and shrunken through having so little food.",
    "ai-mn85:28.11_0": "So that’s what I did.",
    "ai-mn85:28.11_1": "That’s how I grabbed my backbone, and my backbone stick together.",
    "ai-mn85:28.12_0": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.",
    "ai-mn85:28.13_0": "I rubbed this body and my limbs comfortably with my hand.",
    "ai-mn85:28.13_1": "So that’s what I did.",
    "ai-mn85:29.1_0": "Then some people saw me and said,",
