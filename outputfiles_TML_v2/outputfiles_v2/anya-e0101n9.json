A meditator, who wants to develop firstly loving-kindness among these, if he is a beginner, should sever the impediments and learn the meditation subject. Then, when he has done the work connected with the meal and got rid of any diziness due to it, he should seat himself comfortably on a well-prepared seat in a secluded place. To start with, he should review the danger in hate and the advantage in patience.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n9:212_2": "Next he can successively delimit three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, one street, half the village, the whole village, the district, the kingdom, one direction, and so on up to one world-sphere, or even beyond that, and develop loving- kindness towards the beings in such areas.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:212_3": "Likewise with compassion and so on. This is the order in extending here.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:213_0": "267.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:213_1": "The Outcome Just as the immaterial states are the outcome of the kasiṇas, and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is the outcome of concentration, and fruition attainment is the outcome of insight, and the attainment of cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight, so the divine abiding of equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine abidings.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:213_2": "For just as the gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first set up the scaffolding and built the framework of beams, so it is not possible to develop the fourth without having already developed the third jhāna in the earlier .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:214_0": "268.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:214_1": "Four Questions And here it may be asked: But why are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness, and equanimity, called divine abidings?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:214_2": "And why four?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:214_3": "And what is their order? And why are they called measureless states in the Abhidhamma?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:214_4": "It may be replied: The divineness of the abiding should be understood here in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:214_5": "For these abidings are the best in being the right attitude towards beings.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:214_6": "And just as Brahmā gods abide with immaculate minds, so the meditators who associate themselves with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahmā gods.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:215_0": "Here they answers to questions that are suitable for attaining the four enemy, and so on.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:216_0": "Their number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of four;",

    "ai-anya-e0101n9:218_0": "their order to their aim.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:219_0": "Their scope is found to be, so “measureless states” their name.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:220_0": "For among these, loving-kindness is the way to purity for one who has much ill will, compassion is that for one who has much cruelty, gladness is that for one who has much greed.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:220_1": "Also attention given to beings is only fourfold, that is to say, as bringing welfare, as removing suffering, as being glad at their success, and as unconcern, that is to say, impartial neutrality.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:220_2": "And one abiding in the measureless states should practice loving-kindness and the rest like a mother with four sons, namely, a child, an invalid, one in the flush of youth, and one busy with his own affairs; for she wants the child to grow up, wants the invalid to get well, wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long the benefits of youth, and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairs.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:220_3": "That is why the measureless states are only four as “due to paths to purity and other sets of four.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:221_0": "One who wants to develop these four should practice them towards beings first as the promotion of the aspect of welfare—and loving-kindness has the promotion of the aspect of welfare as its characteristic;",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:221_1": "and next, on seeing or hearing or judging that beings whose welfare has been thus wished for are at the mercy of suffering, they should be practiced as the promotion of the aspect of the removal of suffering—and compassion has the promotion of the aspect of the removal of suffering as its characteristic;",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:221_2": "They’ve seen that they scrutinized as being successful and exertioned, and the success of those whose welfare has been wished for and fall asleep.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:221_3": "but he should practice meditation only by doing it by means of the equanimity consisting in neutrality. Equanimity is the middle. And he should practice accordingly.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:221_4": "therefore, since their respective aims are the first aspect of welfare, etc., their order should be understood to correspond, with loving- kindness stated first, then compassion, gladness and equanimity.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:222_0": "All of them, however, occur with a measureless scope,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:222_1": "For beings live having limitless loves,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:222_2": "and instead of assuming a measure such as “Loving- kindness, etc., should be developed only towards a single being, or in an area of such an extent,” they occur with universal pervasion.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:222_3": "Therefore it is said:",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:223_0": "Their number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of four;",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:224_0": "Excellent fifteenth day sabbath,",

    "ai-anya-e0101n9:227_1": "Though they have a single characteristic, having a measureless scope, yet the first three are only of triple and quadruple jhāna respectively in the fourfold and fivefold reckonings, are the first jhāna in the fourfold and fivefold reckonings.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:227_2": "With happiness and fairies,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:227_3": "But why are this joyful and not free of joy?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:227_4": "Because of the arising of ill will, etc.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:227_5": "But the last one of these two jhānas is said to be the first jhāna.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:227_6": "Because it is associated with equanimous feeling.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:227_7": "For it is not known that equanimity of the kind described in the form of neutrality, etc., which is equanimity due to mentality and to inclinations.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:228_0": "271.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:228_1": "However, someone might say this: “It is in that you should develop the four kinds of applied and sustained thought by the Buddha. You should develop it without applied thought and without sustained thought, without placing the mind, but just keeping it connected. You should develop it with rapture. You should develop it without rapture. You should develop it with pleasure. You should develop it with equanimity. You should develop it with equanimity.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:228_2": "He should be told: “Do not put it like that.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:228_3": "For if that were so, then contemplation of the body, etc., would also have quadruple and quintuple jhāna. But there is not even the first jhāna in the contemplation of feeling or in the other two.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:228_4": "That’s why he should pick up a transmigrating phrases, profound, transcendent, deal with embarrassed, and following the teachers of the teachers.”",

That’s why I say this to them: “It seems that you’ve heard the teaching the Dhamma, and that’s why some foolish men, having heard that, Pāṭaliputta, as he was going beyond the teaching, and that’s why there are some foolish people.”",

    "ai-anya-e0101n9:230_1": "After that he told him about its development by means of loving-kindness in this way: “As so, when he has generated, he shouldn’t occupy his mind and body, and bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen remain.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:230_2": "then you should train like this: ‘I will develop the heart’s release by love. I’ll cultivate it, make it my vehicle and my basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:230_3": "In this way you should develop it with loving-kindness towards the training and develop it. Then, when this immersion has been developed and cultivated like this, you should develop it while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ...",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:230_4": "and equanimity is what has been said.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:231_0": "The meaning of this:",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:231_1": "When this immersion is well developed by means of loving-kindness, then you should develop it first with just that much, without applied thought, with sustained thought and without sustained thought.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n9:233_1": "From that it must be understood that the three beginning with loving-kindness have only triple-quadruple jhāna, and that equanimity has only the single remaining jhāna.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n9:233_2": "And they are expounded in the same way in the Abhidhamma as well.",
