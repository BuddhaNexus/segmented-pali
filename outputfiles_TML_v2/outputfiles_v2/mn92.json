    "ai-mn92:1.1_0": "So I have heard.",
    "ai-mn92:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern Āpaṇas together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern Āpaṇas named Āpaṇa.",
    "ai-mn92:2.1_0": "The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard:",
    "ai-mn92:2.2_0": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.",
    "ai-mn92:2.3_0": "He has this good reputation ...” ...",
    "ai-mn92:2.4_0": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
    "ai-mn92:2.5_0": "He realizes with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.",
    "ai-mn92:2.6_0": "He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.",
    "ai-mn92:2.7_0": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.”",
    "ai-mn92:3.1_0": "So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.",
    "ai-mn92:3.2_0": "and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.",
    "ai-mn92:3.3_0": "The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching,",
    "ai-mn92:3.4_0": "Then he said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn92:3.5_0": "“Good Gotama, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with the Sangha of monks.”",
    "ai-mn92:3.6_0": "When he said this, the Buddha said to him,",
    "ai-mn92:3.7_0": "“The Sangha is large, Keṇiya. There are twelve hundred and fifty monks. Moreover, you have confidence in the brahmins.”",
    "ai-mn92:3.8_0": "For a second time ...",
    "ai-mn92:3.9_0": "“Master Gotama, even though the mendicant Saṅgha was devoted to Master Gotama,",

    "ai-mn92:3.15_0": "Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”",
    "ai-mn92:3.16_0": "The Buddha consented by remaining silent.",
    "ai-mn92:4.1_0": "Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage.",
    "ai-mn92:4.1_1": "and after approaching he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, (saying):",
    "ai-mn92:4.2_0": "“Gentlemen, please listen.",
    "ai-mn92:4.3_0": "“The ascetic Gotama has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.",
    "ai-mn92:4.4_0": "Please help me with the preparations.”",
    "ai-mn92:4.5_0": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats.",
    "ai-mn92:4.6_0": "Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself.",
    "ai-mn92:5.1_0": "Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymns.",
    "ai-mn92:6.1_0": "Now at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela.",
    "ai-mn92:6.2_0": "Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage.",
    "ai-mn92:6.3_0": "While some matted-hair ascetic saw some dreadlocked ascetics, some spread out seats at the gates, some spread out seats.",
    "ai-mn92:7.1_0": "and said to Keṇiya,",
    "ai-mn92:7.2_0": "“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?”",
    "ai-mn92:8.1_0": "“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming.",
    "ai-mn92:8.2_0": "Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice.",
    "ai-mn92:8.3_0": "The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.",

    "ai-mn92:8.5_0": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
    "ai-mn92:8.6_0": "He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”",
    "ai-mn92:9.1_0": "“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”",
    "ai-mn92:9.2_0": "“I said ‘the awakened one’.”",
    "ai-mn92:9.3_0": "“Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”",
    "ai-mn92:9.4_0": "“I said ‘the awakened one’.”",
    "ai-mn92:10.1_0": "Then Sela thought,",
    "ai-mn92:10.2_0": "“It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world.",
    "ai-mn92:10.3_0": "The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.",
    "ai-mn92:10.4_0": "If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch.",
    "ai-mn92:10.5_0": "He has the following seven treasures:",
    "ai-mn92:10.6_0": "the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure.",
    "ai-mn92:10.7_0": "He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.",
    "ai-mn92:10.8_0": "After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.",
    "ai-mn92:10.9_0": "But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.”",
    "ai-mn92:11.1_0": "“But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”",
    "ai-mn92:11.2_0": "When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said,",
    "ai-mn92:11.3_0": "“There, Mister Sela, at that line of blue forest.”",
    "ai-mn92:12.1_0": "Then Sela together with three hundred students went to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn92:12.2_0": "Then Sela addressed those students,",
    "ai-mn92:12.3_0": "“Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently.",
    "ai-mn92:12.4_0": "For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone.",
    "ai-mn92:12.5_0": "When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt.",
    "ai-mn92:12.6_0": "Wait until I’ve finished speaking.”",
    "ai-mn92:13.1_0": "Then Sela the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.",
    "ai-mn92:13.2_0": "and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.",
    "ai-mn92:13.3_0": "and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.",
    "ai-mn92:13.4_0": "He saw all of them except for two,",
    "ai-mn92:13.5_0": "which he has doubts about:",
    "ai-mn92:13.6_0": "whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.",
    "ai-mn92:13.7_0": "Then it occurred to him,",
    "ai-mn92:13.8_0": "“This brahmin Sela sees all the marks except for two,",
    "ai-mn92:13.9_0": "which he has doubts about:",
    "ai-mn92:13.10_0": "whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.”",
    "ai-mn92:14.1_0": "The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his retracted private parts.",
    "ai-mn92:14.2_0": "Then the Buddha laid down the early side with both sides.",
    "ai-mn92:14.2_1": "both did and brought them together.",
    "ai-mn92:14.2_2": "And a whole circle of radiates made of tongue.",
    "ai-mn92:15.1_0": "Then Sela thought,",
    "ai-mn92:15.2_0": "“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.",
    "ai-mn92:15.3_0": "But I don’t know whether or not he is an awakened one.",
    "ai-mn92:15.4_0": "I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said:",
    "ai-mn92:15.5_0": "‘Those who are perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised.’",
    "ai-mn92:15.6_0": "Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?”",
    "ai-mn92:15.7_0": "Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:",
    "ai-mn92:16.1_0": "“Puṇṇaka, Suppavāsā,",
    "ai-mn92:16.2_0": "you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;",
