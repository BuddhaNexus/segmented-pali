    "ai-mn53:1.2_0": "at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling amongst the Sakyas, near to Kapilavatthu, in Nigrodha’s Monastery.",
    "ai-mn53:2.1_0": "Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.",
    "ai-mn53:2.2_0": "Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went to the Fortunate One,",
    "ai-mn53:2.2_1": "After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,",
    "ai-mn53:2.2_2": "While sitting on one side the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu said this to the Fortunate One:",
    "ai-mn53:2.3_0": "“Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.",
    "ai-mn53:2.4_0": "May the Buddha be the first to use it,",
    "ai-mn53:2.4_1": "and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it.",

    "ai-mn53:3.1_0": "The Buddha consented by remaining silent.",
    "ai-mn53:3.2_0": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right.",
    "ai-mn53:3.2_1": "and after going, spreading a mattress, spread out a seat, and placed it on the lamps, they went to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn53:3.3_0": "bowed, stood to one side,",
    "ai-mn53:3.4_0": "and told him of their preparations, saying,",
    "ai-mn53:3.5_0": "“Venerable Sir, all the seats have been spread out; a blade covered with water and water jars are ready,",
    "ai-mn53:3.6_0": "adding, “Sir, please come at your convenience.”",
    "ai-mn53:4.1_0": "Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.",

    "ai-mn53:5.1_0": "The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda,",

They have seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.",
    "ai-mn53:7.1_0": "And how is a noble disciple accomplished in ethics?",
    "ai-mn53:7.2_0": "It’s when a noble disciple is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.",

    "ai-mn53:8.1_0": "And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors?",

    "ai-mn53:9.1_0": "And how does a noble disciple eat in moderation?",
    "ai-mn53:9.2_0": "It’s when a noble disciple reflects properly on the food that they eat:",
    "ai-mn53:9.3_0": "‘Not for sport, or for showing off, not for ornament,",
    "ai-mn53:9.3_1": "but only to maintain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual life.",
    "ai-mn53:9.3_2": "In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’",

    "ai-mn53:10.4_0": "In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.",
    "ai-mn53:10.5_0": "In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.",
    "ai-mn53:10.6_0": "That’s how a noble disciple is dedicated to wakefulness.",
    "ai-mn53:11.1_0": "And how does a noble disciple have seven good qualities?",
    "ai-mn53:11.2_0": "It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening ...",
    "ai-mn53:11.3_0": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
    "ai-mn53:12.1_0": "They have a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities.",
    "ai-mn53:13.1_0": "They exercise prudence. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities.",
    "ai-mn53:14.1_0": "They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned.",
    "ai-mn53:14.1_1": "...",
    "ai-mn53:15.1_0": "They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.",
    "ai-mn53:16.1_0": "They’re mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.",
    "ai-mn53:17.1_0": "They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.",
    "ai-mn53:17.2_0": "That’s how a noble disciple has seven good qualities.",
    "ai-mn53:18.1_0": "And how does a noble disciple get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty?",
    "ai-mn53:18.2_0": "It’s when a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption ...",
    "ai-mn53:18.3_0": "second absorption ...",
    "ai-mn53:18.4_0": "And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’",
    "ai-mn53:18.5_0": "fourth absorption.",
    "ai-mn53:18.5_1": "dwells having attained the fourth absorption.",
    "ai-mn53:18.6_0": "That’s how a noble disciple gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.",
    "ai-mn53:19.1_0": "When a noble disciple is practicing all these things they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme sanctuary.",
    "ai-mn53:19.2_0": "Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that chicken doesn’t wish,",
    "ai-mn53:19.3_0": "‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’",
    "ai-mn53:19.4_0": "But still they can break out and hatch safely.",
    "ai-mn53:19.5_0": "In the same way, when a noble disciple is practicing all these things they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme sanctuary.",
    "ai-mn53:20.1_0": "Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives.",
    "ai-mn53:20.2_0": "That is:",
    "ai-mn53:20.2_1": "They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.",
    "ai-mn53:20.3_0": "This is their first breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.",
    "ai-mn53:21.1_0": "Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn ...",

    "ai-mn53:25.6_0": "is first among gods and humans.’",
    "ai-mn53:25.7_0": "And that verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by the Buddha.”",
    "ai-mn53:26.1_0": "Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda,",
    "ai-mn53:26.2_0": "“Good, good, Ānanda.",
    "ai-mn53:26.3_0": "It’s good that you’ve missed the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.”",
    "ai-mn53:26.4_0": "This is what Venerable Ānanda said,",
    "ai-mn53:26.5_0": "and the teacher approved.",
    "ai-mn53:26.6_0": "Satisfied, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu were happy with what Venerable Ānanda said.",
