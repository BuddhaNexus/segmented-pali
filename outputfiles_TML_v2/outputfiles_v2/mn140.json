    "ai-mn140:31.2_0": "Identification is a disease, a boil, a dart.",
    "ai-mn140:31.3_0": "Having gone beyond all identification, one is called a sage at peace.",
    "ai-mn140:31.4_0": "The sage at peace is not reborn, does not grow old, and does not die. They are not shaken, and do not yearn.",
    "ai-mn140:31.5_0": "For if you don’t know what happens, what will you think of them?",
    "ai-mn140:32.1_0": "‘They have four foundations, standing on which the streams of identification don’t flow. And when the streams of identification don’t flow, they’re called a sage at peace.’",
    "ai-mn140:32.2_0": "That’s why I said what I said.",
    "ai-mn140:32.3_0": "Mendicant, you should remember this brief analysis of the six elements.”",
    "ai-mn140:33.1_0": "Then Venerable Pukkusāti thought,",
    "ai-mn140:33.2_0": "“It seems the Teacher has come to me! The Holy One has come to me! The fully awakened Buddha has come to me!” He got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, and said,",
    "ai-mn140:33.3_0": "“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to presume to address the Buddha as ‘reverend’.",
    "ai-mn140:33.4_0": "Please accept my confession for my future restraint.”",
    "ai-mn140:33.5_0": "“Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.",
    "ai-mn140:33.6_0": "But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.",
    "ai-mn140:33.7_0": "For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”",
    "ai-mn140:34.1_0": "“Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”",
    "ai-mn140:34.2_0": "“But mendicant, are your bowl and robes complete?”",
    "ai-mn140:34.3_0": "“No, sir, they are not.”",
    "ai-mn140:34.4_0": "“The Realized Ones do not ordain those whose bowl and robes are incomplete.”",
    "ai-mn140:35.1_0": "And then Venerable Pukkusāti approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
    "ai-mn140:35.2_0": "But while he was wandering in search of a bowl and robes, a stray cow took his life.",
    "ai-mn140:36.1_0": "Then many monks went to the Fortunate One,",
    "ai-mn140:36.1_1": "After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,",
    "ai-mn140:36.1_2": "They did as he asked.",
    "ai-mn140:36.2_0": "“Sir, the gentleman named Pukkusāti, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.",
    "ai-mn140:36.3_0": "Where have they been reborn in the next life?”",
    "ai-mn140:36.4_0": "“Mendicants, Pukkusāti was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.",
    "ai-mn140:36.5_0": "With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”",
    "ai-mn140:36.6_0": "That is what the Buddha said.",
    "ai-mn140:36.7_0": "Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.",
    "ai-mn140:36.8_0": "The tenth chapter on the analysis is finished."
