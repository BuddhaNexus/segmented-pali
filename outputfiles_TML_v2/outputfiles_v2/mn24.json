    "ai-mn24:1.2_0": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.",
    "ai-mn24:2.1_0": "Then several mendicants who had completed the rainy season residence in their native land went to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn24:2.1_1": "After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,",
    "ai-mn24:2.1_2": "They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them,",
    "ai-mn24:2.2_0": "“In your native land, mendicants, which of the native mendicants is esteemed in this way:",
    "ai-mn24:2.3_0": "‘Personally having few wishes, they speak to the mendicants on having few wishes. Personally having contentment, seclusion, aloofness, energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom, they speak to the mendicants on all these things. They’re an adviser and instructor, one who educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires their spiritual companions.’”",

    "ai-mn24:3.1_0": "Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn24:3.2_0": "Then he thought,",
    "ai-mn24:3.3_0": "“Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta is fortunate, so very fortunate,",
    "ai-mn24:3.4_0": "in that his sensible spiritual companions praise him point by point in the presence of the Teacher, and that the Teacher seconds that appreciation.",
    "ai-mn24:3.5_0": "Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa, and we can have a discussion.”",

    "ai-mn24:5.3_0": "The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.",
    "ai-mn24:5.4_0": "Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Puṇṇa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.",
    "ai-mn24:6.1_0": "Then a certain monk went to venerable Sāriputta,",
    "ai-mn24:6.1_1": "and after going, he said this to venerable Sāriputta:",
    "ai-mn24:6.2_0": "“Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant named Puṇṇa, of whom you have often spoken so highly, after being inspired by a talk of the Buddha’s, left for the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”",
    "ai-mn24:7.1_0": "Sāriputta quickly grabbed his sitting cloth and followed behind Puṇṇa, keeping sight of his head.",

    "ai-mn24:15.1_0": "“In the same way, reverend, purification of ethics is only for the sake of purification of mind. Purification of mind is only for the sake of purification of view. Purification of view is only for the sake of purification through overcoming doubt. Purification through overcoming doubt. Purification through overcoming doubt is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the variety of paths. Purification of knowledge and vision of the practice. Purification of knowledge and vision of the practice is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision. Purification of knowledge and vision of the practice is only for the sake of extinguishment by not grasping.",
