    "ai-mn86:2.1_0": "At that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.",
    "ai-mn86:2.2_0": "He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.",
    "ai-mn86:2.3_0": "He is constantly murdering people, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.",
    "ai-mn86:3.1_0": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.",
    "ai-mn86:3.2_0": "Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, he walked down the road that led to Aṅgulimāla.",
    "ai-mn86:3.3_0": "The cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers saw him on the road,",

    "ai-mn86:6.17_0": "and asked her the going forth right away.",
    "ai-mn86:6.18_0": "Then the Buddha, the compassionate great hermit,",
    "ai-mn86:6.19_0": "the teacher of the world with its gods,",
    "ai-mn86:6.20_0": "said to him, “Come, monk!”",
    "ai-mn86:6.21_0": "And with that he became a monk.",
    "ai-mn86:7.1_0": "Then the Buddha set out for Sāvatthī with Venerable Aṅgulimāla as his second monk.",
    "ai-mn86:7.2_0": "When he eventually arrived,",
    "ai-mn86:7.3_0": "he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.",
    "ai-mn86:8.1_0": "Now at that time a crowd had gathered by the gate of King Pasenadi’s royal compound making a dreadful racket,",
    "ai-mn86:8.2_0": "“In your realm, Your Majesty, there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.",

    "ai-mn86:8.5_0": "Please accept it.”",
    "ai-mn86:9.1_0": "Then King Pasenadi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day with around five hundred horses,",
    "ai-mn86:9.2_0": "heading for the monastery.",
    "ai-mn86:9.3_0": "He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.",
    "ai-mn86:9.3_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn86:9.3_2": "The Buddha said to him:",
    "ai-mn86:9.4_0": "“Great king, why does King Bimbisāra or Magadha residing in Vesālī?”",
    "ai-mn86:10.1_0": "“No, sir.",
    "ai-mn86:10.2_0": "In my realm there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. ...",
    "ai-mn86:10.3_0": "He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.",
    "ai-mn86:10.4_0": "He is constantly murdering people, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.",
    "ai-mn86:10.5_0": "I shall put a stop to him.”",
    "ai-mn86:11.1_0": "“But great king, suppose you were to see that Aṅgulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. And that he was refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and lying; that he was eating in one part of the day, and was celibate, ethical, and of good character. What would you do to him?”",
    "ai-mn86:11.2_0": "“I would bow to him, rise in his presence, or offer him a seat. I’d invite him to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize his lawful guarding and protection.",
    "ai-mn86:11.3_0": "But sir, how could such an immoral, evil man ever have such virtue and restraint?”",
    "ai-mn86:12.1_0": "Now at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla was sitting not far from the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn86:12.2_0": "Then the Buddha said to him,",
    "ai-mn86:12.3_0": "“Great king, this is Aṅgulimāla.”",
    "ai-mn86:12.4_0": "Then the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end.",
    "ai-mn86:12.5_0": "Knowing this, the Buddha said to him,",
    "ai-mn86:12.6_0": "“Don’t fear, great king, there is no fear for you.”",
    "ai-mn86:12.7_0": "Then the king’s fear died down.",
    "ai-mn86:12.8_0": "Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi went over to Aṅgulimāla,",
    "ai-mn86:12.8_1": "and after going, he said this to venerable Aṅgulimāla:",
    "ai-mn86:12.9_0": "“Sir, is the venerable really Aṅgulimāla?”",
    "ai-mn86:12.10_0": "“Yes, great king.”",
    "ai-mn86:12.11_0": "“What clans were your father and mother from?”",
    "ai-mn86:12.12_0": "“My father was a Gagga, and my mother a Mantāṇī.”",
    "ai-mn86:12.13_0": "“May the venerable Gagga Mantāṇīputta be happy.",
    "ai-mn86:12.14_0": "I’ll make sure that you’re provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”",
    "ai-mn86:13.1_0": "But at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, and owned just three robes.",
    "ai-mn86:13.2_0": "So he said to the king,",
    "ai-mn86:13.3_0": "“Enough, great king. My robes are complete.”",
    "ai-mn86:13.4_0": "Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi went to the Fortunate One,",
    "ai-mn86:13.4_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn86:13.4_2": "Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn86:13.5_0": "“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,",
    "ai-mn86:13.6_0": "How the Buddha tames those who are wild, pacifies those who are violent, and extinguishes those who are unextinguished!",
    "ai-mn86:13.7_0": "For I was not able to tame him with the rod and the sword, but the Buddha tamed him without rod or sword.",
    "ai-mn86:13.8_0": "Well, now, sir, I must go.",
    "ai-mn86:13.9_0": "I have many duties, and much to do.”",
    "ai-mn86:13.10_0": "“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”",
    "ai-mn86:13.11_0": "Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
    "ai-mn86:14.1_0": "Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.",
    "ai-mn86:14.2_0": "Then as he was wandering indiscriminately for alms-food he saw a woman undergoing a painful obstructed labor.",
    "ai-mn86:14.3_0": "Having seen (that), this occurred to him:",
    "ai-mn86:14.4_0": "“Oh, beings suffer such filth!",
    "ai-mn86:14.5_0": "Oh, beings!”",
    "ai-mn86:14.6_0": "Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn86:14.6_1": "bowed, sat down,",
    "ai-mn86:14.6_2": "The Buddha said to him,",
    "ai-mn86:14.7_0": "“Here I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.",
    "ai-mn86:14.8_0": "I saw her doing this.",
    "ai-mn86:14.9_0": "Having seen (that), this occurred to me:",
    "ai-mn86:14.10_0": "‘Oh, beings suffer such filth! How sentient beings are defilements!’”",
    "ai-mn86:15.1_0": "“Well then, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:",
    "ai-mn86:15.2_0": "‘Ever since I was born, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”",
    "ai-mn86:15.3_0": "“But sir, wouldn’t that be telling a deliberate lie?",
    "ai-mn86:15.4_0": "For I have intentionally killed many living creatures.”",
    "ai-mn86:15.5_0": "“Well then, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:",
    "ai-mn86:15.6_0": "‘Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”",
    "ai-mn86:15.7_0": "“Yes, sir,” replied Aṅgulimāla. He went to that woman.",
    "ai-mn86:15.7_1": "and after going, he said this to that woman:",
    "ai-mn86:15.8_0": "“Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.”",
    "ai-mn86:15.9_0": "Then that woman was safe, and so was her baby.",
    "ai-mn86:16.1_0": "Then Aṅgulimāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.",
    "ai-mn86:16.2_0": "He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”",
    "ai-mn86:16.3_0": "And Venerable Aṅgulimāla became one of the perfected.",
    "ai-mn86:17.1_0": "Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.",
    "ai-mn86:17.2_0": "Now at that time someone threw a stone that hit Aṅgulimāla, someone else threw a stick, and someone else threw gravel.",
    "ai-mn86:17.3_0": "Then Aṅgulimāla—with cracked head, bleeding, his bowl broken, and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha.",
    "ai-mn86:17.4_0": "The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance,",
    "ai-mn86:17.5_0": "and said to him,",
    "ai-mn86:17.6_0": "“Endure it, brahmin! Endure it, brahmin!",
    "ai-mn86:17.7_0": "You’re experiencing in this life the result of deeds that might have caused you to be tormented in hell for many years, many hundreds or thousands of years.”",
    "ai-mn86:18.1_0": "Later, Venerable Aṅgulimāla was experiencing the bliss of release while in private retreat.",
    "ai-mn86:18.2_0": "on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:",
    "ai-mn86:18.3_0": "“He who once was heedless,",
