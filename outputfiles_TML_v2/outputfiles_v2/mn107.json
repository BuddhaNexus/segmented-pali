    "ai-mn107:1.3_0": "Then the brahmin Moggallāna the Accountant went up to the Buddha,",
    "ai-mn107:1.3_1": "exchanged pleasantries with him,",
    "ai-mn107:1.4_0": "and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.",

    "ai-mn107:2.1_0": "“Master Gotama, in this stilt longhouse we can see gradual progress",
    "ai-mn107:2.2_0": "down to the last step of the staircase.",

    "ai-mn107:3.4_0": "‘Come, mendicant, be ethical and restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.’",
    "ai-mn107:4.1_0": "When they have ethical conduct, the Realized One guides them further:",
    "ai-mn107:4.2_0": "‘Come, mendicant, guard your sense doors. When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details.",

    "ai-mn107:6.2_0": "‘Come, mendicant, committed to wakefulness. In the evening, you should practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the day, purifying your mind from obstacles. In the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.’",

    "ai-mn107:7.2_0": "‘Come, mendicant, have mindfulness and situational awareness. Act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.’",

    "ai-mn107:8.2_0": "‘Come, mendicant, frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.’",
    "ai-mn107:9.1_0": "So they frequent a secluded lodging.",
    "ai-mn107:9.2_0": "After the meal, they return from alms-round, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.",
    "ai-mn107:9.3_0": "Giving up desire for the world, he meditates with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.",

    "ai-mn107:10.1_0": "They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.",
    "ai-mn107:10.2_0": "Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption ...",

    "ai-mn107:10.5_0": "fourth absorption.",
    "ai-mn107:11.1_0": "That’s how I instruct the mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary.",
    "ai-mn107:11.2_0": "But for those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—these things lead to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness.”",

    "ai-mn107:14.4_0": "“Yes, I am.”",
    "ai-mn107:14.5_0": "“What do you think, brahmin?",
    "ai-mn107:14.6_0": "Suppose a person was to come along who wanted to go to Rājagaha.",

    "ai-mn107:15.3_0": "But there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are committed to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise, not stupid. Master Gotama does live together with these.",

    "ai-mn107:17.1_0": "Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!",
    "ai-mn107:17.2_0": "Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that",
    "ai-mn107:17.2_1": "so that one with eyes might see what’s there—",
    "ai-mn107:17.2_2": "just so has the Dhamma been explained by the dear Gotama in countless ways.",
    "ai-mn107:17.3_0": "Good Gotama, I go for refuge to you, and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks.",
