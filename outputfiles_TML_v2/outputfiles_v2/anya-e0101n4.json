    "ai-anya-e0101n4:128_2": "Or, alternatively, it is mentioned in the first phrase because it is sense desire as defilement and in the second phrase because it is included in the “unprofitable.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:128_3": "and has said to schism in the midst of sensual pleasures,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:129_0": "And although there may be unprofitableness in other states as well, nevertheless only the hindrances are mentioned subsequently in the Vibhaṅga thus: “Herein, what states are unprofitable? Lust ...” , etc., in order to show their opposition to, and incompatibility with, the jhāna factors.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:129_1": "For the hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors: the jhāna factors are drawn away from them.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:129_2": "And it is said accordingly in the Peṭaka : “Concentration is incompatible with lust, happiness with ill will, applied thought with stiffness and torpor, bliss with agitation and worry, and sustained thought with uncertainty” .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:130_0": "So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by suppression of lust is indicated by the phrase quite secluded from sense desires,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:130_1": "and seclusion by suppression of all five hindrances by the phrase secluded from unprofitable things. But omitting repetitions, that of lust is indicated by the first and that of the remaining hindrances by the second.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:130_2": "Similarly with the three unprofitable roots, that of greed, which has the five cords of sense desire as its province, is indicated by the first, and that of hate and delusion, which have as their respective provinces the various grounds for annoyance , etc., by the second.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:130_3": "Or with the states consisting of the floods, etc., that of the flood of sense desires, of the bonding of sense desires, of the canker of vanity, of the fetter of greed, and of the fetter of greed for sensual pleasures, and that of the fetter of greed for sensual pleasures, is indicated by the first, and that of the remaining floods.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:130_5": "Furthermore, that of the eight thought- arisings associated with greed is indicated by the first, and that of the remaining kinds of unprofitable thought-arisings is indicated by the second.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:130_6": "This, in the first place, is the meaning of the quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:131_1": "So far the factors abandoned by the first jhāna have been shown. And now, in order to show the factors associated with it, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought is said.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:131_2": "Herein, applied thinking is applied thought ;",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:131_3": "It has the characteristic of directing the mind on to an object . Its function is to strike at and thresh",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:133_0": "And, though sometimes not separate, applied thought is the first impact of the mind in the sense that it is both gross and inceptive, like the striking of a bell.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:133_1": "Sustained thought is the act of keeping the mind anchored, in the sense that it is subtle with the individual essence of continued pressure, like the ringing of the bell.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:133_2": "Applied thought intervenes, being the interference of consciousness at the time of first arousing thought, like a bird’s spreading out its wings when about to soar into the air, and like a bee’s diving towards a lotus when it is minded to follow up the scent of it.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:133_3": "(but) the peaceful, being neither too close nor too loose, like a bird with the air, like a stretching for the air. When the mind is drawing into it, it is like a lotus opening, like a lotus opening,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:133_4": "In the commentary to the Book of Twos this is said: “Appplied thought occurs as a state of directing the mind onto an object, like the movement of the air with both engaging the air with the air with both wings and forcing them downwards. For it causes absorption by being unified.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:133_5": "From effort it occurs when the wind is finished, like the sun’s float, like a poisonous victory in a lake. For it occurs only when the wind is carried along with the bowels.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:133_6": "This difference of theirs becomes evident in the first and second jhānas in the fivefold reckoning.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:134_0": "Furthermore, applied thought is like the hand that grips firmly and sustained thought is like the hand that rubs, when one grips a tarnished metal dish firmly with one hand and rubs it with one hand and rubs it with the other hand.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:134_1": "Likewise, when a potter has spun his wheel with a stroke on the stick and is making a dish , his supporting hand is like applied thought and his hand that moves back and forth is like sustained thought.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:134_2": "Likewise, when one is drawing a circle, the pin that stays fixed down in the centre is like applied thought, which directs onto the object, and the pin that revolves round it is like sustained thought, which continuously presses.",

She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood looking at the Ākāsacetiya Shrine at Girikaṇḍaka lit by the moon. She saw the offering of lamps at the shrine, and the four communities as they circumambulated it.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:137_2": "Then she thought, “How lucky they are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma!” Seeing the shrine as a mound of pearls,",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:196_5": "But when taken as conjoining the words “stilling of applied and sustained thought,” then the construction to be understood is “with the fading of happiness and, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought.”",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:220_4": "But it should be understood that these two factors possesses two factors .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:220_5": "That is why it is said in the Vibhaṅga: “He dwells in equanimity, mindful and aware, possesses mindfulness of breathing, in other words, the mind and mindfulness of breathing, I say.”",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:220_6": "But, excepting the equanimity and mindfulness and full awareness, this jhāna has literally only two factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of lighting ,",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:220_7": "“What’s the wrong time?”",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:222_1": "Once this has been obtained in this way, and once he has mastery in the five ways already described, then on emerging from the now familiar second jhāna, he can regard the flaws in it thus: ‘This attainment is threatened by the nearness of happiness; ‘Whatever there is in it of mental concern about bliss proclaims its grossness’ , and its factors are weakened by the grosness of the bliss so expressed. ” He can bring the fourth jhāna to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the third absorption.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:222_2": "When he has emerged from the third absorption, the bliss, in other words, the mental joy, appears gross to him as he reviews the jhāna factors with mindfulness and full awareness, while the equanimity as feeling and the unification of mind appear peaceful. Then, as he brings that same sign to mind as “earth, earth” again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors, knowing “now the fourth absorption,” there arises in him mind-door adverting with that same earth kasiṇa as its object, interrupting the life-continuum.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:222_3": "After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same object, the last one of which is an impulsion of the fine-material sphere belonging to the fourth jhāna. The rest are of the kinds already stated .",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:222_4": "And this is the fourth kind of feeling associated with pleasant feeling.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:222_5": "And although it is associated with equanimity, it is prevailed.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:222_6": "And at this point, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:222_7": "and so he has attained the fourth absorption, which has three factors, possesses two factors, is good in three ways, possesses ten characteristics, and is endowed with ten characteristics.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:223_1": "Herein, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain: with the abandoning of bodily pleasure and bodily pain.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:224_0": "But when is it combined?",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:224_1": "In the four absorptions, each instance.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:224_2": "For mental joy is only abandoned at the moment of the fourth-jhāna access,",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:225_0": "But if these are only abandoned at the moments of access of the several jhānas, why is their cessation said to. take place in the jhāna itself in the following passage: “But where does the faculty cease without anything left over, mendicant?”",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:225_4": "fourth absorption ...",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:225_5": "Because of the cessation of defilements,",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_0": "For if a man has entered upon the first jhāna and weakened in the first jhāna, then for non-decluded in the second-jhāna access or decrease, it may be appropriate to say that there could be reappearing in that way.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_1": "Or else, though it has ceased during access, it has not absolutely ceased there since it is not quite beaten out by opposition.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_2": "But during absorption the whole body is showered with bliss owing to pervasion by happiness.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_3": "And during the second-jhāna access too, which has multiple advertings, there could be rearising of the mental grief faculty, although it had already ceased there, because it arises when there is bodily weariness and mental vexation, which have applied thought and sustained thought.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_4": "but it does not arise when applied and sustained thought are absent.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_5": "When it arises, it does so in the presence of applied and sustained thought, and they are not abandoned in the second-jhāna access; but this is not so in the second jhāna itself because its conditions are abandoned there.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_6": "Likewise in the third-jhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned bodily pleasure faculty in one whose body was pervaded by the superior materiality originated by the consciousness associated with the happiness. But not so in the third jhāna itself.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_7": "For in the third jhāna the happiness that is a condition for the bodily bliss has ceased entirely.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_8": "Likewise in the fourth-jhāna access there could be rejoicing the joy faculty without applied thought. But if it has been abandoned there, he may not because of the fourth jhāna.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:226_9": "And that’s why in that case the arisen pain faculty ceases without anything left over.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:227_0": "Here it may be asked: if these kinds of feeling are abandoned in that, why are they brought in here?”",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:227_2": "For the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling described here by the words “which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure” is subtle, hard to recognize and not readily grasped. So just as, when a cattle-herd wants to catch a refractory ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it, he collects all the cattle into one pen and lets them out one by one, and then he says “That is it; catch it,” and so it gets caught as well, so too the Buddha has collected all these five kinds of feeling together so that they can be grasped readily;",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:231_2": "By this he indicates the third kind of feeling that is in opposition, which is independent on suffering, not-self in suffering.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:231_3": "A third neutral feeling is said to be “equanimous bliss”.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:231_4": "It has the characteristic of experiencing what is contrary to both the desirable and the undesirable. Its function is neutral. Its manifestation is unevident. Its proximate cause should be understood as the cessation of pleasure .",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:232_1": "For the mindfulness in this jhāna is quite purified, and its purification is effected by equanimity, not by anything else.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:232_2": "That is why it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:232_5": "And the equanimity due to which there comes to be this purity of mindfulness should be understood as specific neutrality in meaning.",
    "ai-anya-e0101n4:232_6": "And not only mindfulness is purified by it here, but also all associated states. However, the teaching is given under the heading of mindfulness.",

    "ai-anya-e0101n4:233_2": "and because it is not purified, the conascent mindfulness and other states are not purified either, like the unpurified crescent moon’s radiance by day.",
