    "ai-mn68:2.1_0": "Now at that time several very well-known gentlemen had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in the Buddha—",
    "ai-mn68:2.2_0": "The venerables Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Koṇḍañña, Revata, Ānanda, and other very well-known gentlemen.",
    "ai-mn68:3.1_0": "Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the mendicant Saṅgha.",
    "ai-mn68:3.2_0": "Then the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those gentlemen:",
    "ai-mn68:3.3_0": "“Mendicants, those gentlemen who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in me—I trust they’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”",
